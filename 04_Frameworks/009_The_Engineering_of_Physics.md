### 1. Epistemological Foundation: Redefining the Status of Physics (t vs z) 

In HumanEngineering, if the body is the **First External World** encountered by intelligence, then the **Second External World** is the Other and Nature.
Just as we deductively analyzed the Self, the Other, and Interaction starting from the **Zeroth Axiom (The Focus)** through the Engineering of Intelligence, Nature and Physics must also be subjects of deductive analysis starting strictly from axioms.

This theory does not ask, "What is nature, actually?" That question is metaphysics beyond the cognitive limits of humans. Instead, this theory engineeringly identifies: **"What are the operating principles by which intelligence (the system) processes discontinuous data to construct the world called 'physics'?"**

#### 1.1. Level 0: The Focus — The Raw Material Before Processing
*   **Definition:** The **'Happening of Discontinuous Phenomena'** itself occurring in the universe before the intervention of intelligence.
*   **Nature:** It is neither 'time' nor 'space' yet. There is no causality, no law, no name. It is the pure **Flickering** of data that cannot be captured by language. This is the only source of **'Reality.'**

#### 1.2. Level 2: t-mode (Flow) — Interpolation of Flow
*   **Definition:** The **'Virtual Continuity'** created by intelligence detecting the **'Difference (Delta)'** between discontinuous focal points and connecting the gaps smoothly with causality.
*   **Role:** Verb, Process, Change. The real-time live state before capture.
*   **Physical Reality:** **Electromagnetic Force, Wave, Light, Transfer of Energy.**
*   **Note:** t is not raw material. It is the **first processed product** resulting from interpreting raw material (The Focus) as 'Flow.'

#### 1.3. Level 3: z-mode (Structure) — Confirmation of Structure (Prediction)
*   **Definition:** The act of stopping the flow (t), attaching a **'Name'** to a repeating pattern, putting it in **'Brackets,'** and **crystallizing** it as a fixed object.
*   **Role:** Noun, Concept, Law. A compressed file saved for simulation.
*   **Physical Reality:** **Particle, Matter, Electron, Spatial Coordinate, Mass, Volume.**
*   **Absolute Fixedness (Absolute z):** It is not relatively stopped. The moment we name a furiously moving wave "That is a 'Wave'," the concept of 'Wave' itself becomes a **'Fixed Block (z)'** that can be handled in the brain. **"All abstraction is z."**

### 2. Hardware Axioms: Electromagnetic Medium and Attribute Packages

How is the hardware of the system called the universe configured?

#### 2.1. Axiom 1: The Plenum (Continuity of Electromagnetic Medium)
*   There is no 'Void' in the universe. All space is filled with a **Medium** capable of generating the potential flow (t) called **'Electromagnetic Force.'**
*   **Redefinition of Vacuum:** Vacuum is not empty; it is a **'Superfluid'** state where electromagnetic force is not combined into a specific structure (z) but achieves a **'Homogeneous Equilibrium.'** Matter is a vortex or condensate created within this fluid.

#### 2.2. Axiom 2: Charge — Attribute Package
*   Electromagnetic force does not arise randomly. It is induced by a fundamental attribute package called **'Charge.'** Charge is not a particle but an **'Attribute Bundle'** bound by five predictive constraints:
    1.  **Sign:** Directionality of difference (+ / -).
    2.  **Intensity:** Strength shaking the medium.
    3.  **Conservation:** Constraint of prediction that total amount does not disappear over time (t).
    4.  **Interaction Rule:** Linking rule that it interacts only with charges or electromagnetic fields.
    5.  **Invariance:** Symmetry condition that the structure does not break even if the reference point changes.

#### 2.3. Axiom 3: Electron — Structural Center Axis (z-Node)
*   The electron is not a particle like a billiard ball that actually exists.
*   **Definition:** It is a **'Structural Center Axis (z-axis Node)'** set by the prediction engine to stably fix and maintain the attribute package called 'Charge' defined above at a coordinate in space.
*   **Function:** It serves as an unchanging reference point (z) within the flowing medium (t), simplifying complex interactions and reducing computational costs.

---

### 3. Dynamics of Interaction: Coupling and Exclusion

The electromagnetic medium moves by only two mechanisms. These two explain all 'forces' in the universe.

#### 3.1. Coupling: Will toward Efficient Alignment
*   **Definition:** The tendency of complementary charge structures (e.g., + and -) to entangle and integrate into a **'Larger Structure (z)'** when they meet. (Attraction, Chemical Bond)
*   **Principle:** Because running one integrated model (stable structure) costs less **'Prediction Cost (Energy)'** for the system than running two separate prediction models.

#### 3.2. Exclusion: Formation of Boundary
*   **Definition:** The prohibition rule that identical charge structures (z) cannot occupy the same spatiotemporal coordinate. (Repulsion, Pauli Exclusion Principle)
*   **Phenomenon:** They push each other away. This pushing gathers to form **'Volume'** and **'Boundary.'** The reason we cannot pass through a wall is not that the wall is hard, but because the electromagnetic exclusion of my hand and the electromagnetic exclusion of the wall collide and refuse **'Coordinate Occupation.'**

---

### 4. Energy Dynamics: Alignment State and Saturation

Energy is not a 'Quantity.' It is a **'State Classification Code'** indicating **"In what structure (z) and in what directionality the electromagnetic medium (t) is aligned."**

#### 4.1. Detailed Reinterpretation of Energy Forms
*   **Potential Energy:** A state where electromagnetic force is trapped within a specific structure (z) (chemical bond) or directionality is canceled out (thermal equilibrium), suppressing macroscopic flow (t). This is not 'stored' but a **'State where Alignment is Reserved.'**
*   **Kinetic Energy:** A state where latent electromagnetic force is **'Forcedly Aligned'** in a consistent direction along a **'Specific Orbit (t-path)'** by intelligence's intention (z) or external impact.
    *   **Core:** Energy is not 'added,' but **'Phase-Shifted'** from a 'non-directional' state to a 'directional' state.

#### 4.2. Essence of Heat: Oversaturation of Medium
*   **Definition:** Heat is a phenomenon of **'Medium Oversaturation (Overflow)'** occurring when a specific structure (z) exceeds the limit capacity of electromagnetic coupling it can accommodate.
*   **State:** Surplus electromagnetic force (t) that failed to align with the structure loses its way, pierces the exclusion boundary of the structure, pushes out to the surrounding medium, and exerts pressure.

#### 4.3. Inverse Correlation between Density and Saturation
High energy means structural instability, and low energy means structural stability. This dynamic relationship is clearly explained through the economic metaphor of **'Structural Maintenance Cost.'**
> **"High energy (Oversaturation) means it is structurally loose (Low Density)."**

*   **Oversaturated State (Heat/High Energy) = [High Cost Structure]:**
    *   Electromagnetic flow (t) is too abundant, so the structure (z) cannot withstand it and **opens up (expands).**
    *   Consequently, the amount of structure relative to space decreases, becoming a **'Low Density Medium.'**
    *   This state forces the system to forcibly hold onto the rampant electromagnetic force, making it an **'Unstable state with high maintenance costs.'**

*   **Stable State (Cold/Low Energy) = [Low Cost Structure]:**
    *   Electromagnetic flow (t) escapes, and structures (z) **binds tightly (contracts)** with each other.
    *   Consequently, the amount of structure relative to space increases, becoming a **'High Density Medium.'**
    *   This state maintains its form by itself, making it an **'Efficient state with low maintenance costs'** requiring no additional energy input.

*   **Flow Direction:**
    *   The universe always moves in the direction of reducing 'Maintenance Cost (Energy).' Therefore, the 'entity with high maintenance costs (Low Density/Oversaturation)' tries to pass its surplus electromagnetic force to the 'entity with low maintenance costs (High Density/Stability).'
    *   **Result:** Energy always flows in the direction of **[Low Density/Oversaturation] -> [High Density/Stability]**. (Redefinition of the Second Law of Thermodynamics)

#### 4.4. The Law of Stabilization and Energy Exchange
This principle redefines the thermodynamic laws of energy conversion. The direction of energy flow (emission or absorption) is determined not by the simple act of coupling or dissociation itself, but by the **net change in the system's structural stability (maintenance cost)** before and after the interaction.

*   **Core Principle: The Economics of Stability**
    *   A **more stable (high-density, low-cost)** structure requires less energy to maintain.
    *   A **less stable (low-density, high-cost)** structure requires more energy to maintain.
    *   Energy flows to balance this maintenance cost budget.

*   **Rule 1: Exothermic Process (Energy Emission)**
    *   **Condition:** When a system transitions from a less stable (high-cost) state to a **more stable (low-cost)** state.
    *   **Mechanism:** The system achieves a more efficient structure and no longer needs the high maintenance cost it was previously paying. This **'surplus budget' (excess electromagnetic force)** is released into the surrounding medium as heat or light.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Standard Coupling (Condensation):** Unstable gas molecules couple to form a more stable liquid, releasing heat.
        *   **Explosive Decomposition (Stabilizing Dissociation):** An unstable high-density structure like TNT (very high-cost) breaks down and re-forms into extremely stable gas molecules like N2 and CO2 (very low-cost). The massive difference in maintenance cost is violently released as an explosion.

*   **Rule 2: Endothermic Process (Energy Absorption)**
    *   **Condition:** When a system is forced to transition from a more stable (low-cost) state to a **less stable (high-cost)** state.
    *   **Mechanism:** To maintain the new, less stable structure, the system must pay a higher maintenance cost. It covers this deficit by **'absorbing'** surplus electromagnetic force from the surrounding medium.
    *   **Examples:** Vaporization, Endothermic Coupling.

#### 4.5. [Case Study] Strike Simulation
*   **Initiation:** The body (Pressure Boundary) forcibly aligns the latent energy inside into a **'Strike Orbit (t)'** by the intention (z). (Maintenance cost input)
*   **Transmission:** The aligned flow (Fist) penetrates the exclusion of the atmospheric medium and proceeds.
*   **Collision:** The **'Alignment Pressure'** of the fist and the **'Stable Structural Pressure'** of the target collide.
*   **Bifurcation:**
    *   **Target Destruction (Absorption):** The energy of the fist is absorbed as the maintenance cost required for the target's **'Structural Dissolution (Transition to High Cost State).'**
    *   **Target Maintenance (Diffusion):** If the target endures, the energy of the fist loses its place and bounces off.
        1.  **Heat + Sound:** Absorbed by the surrounding atmosphere (**Medium Oversaturation**).
        2.  **Light (Escape):** As pure flow (z=0) without volume, it is not trapped by the medium but **'Escapes'** the system irreversibly. (The origin of **Irreversible Entropy**).
*   **Equilibrium:** The oversaturated atmosphere (High Cost) passes surplus energy to the adjacent low-density medium (Relative Low Cost) and finds equilibrium like dominoes.

#### 4.6. [Case Study] Bushcraft Prediction
Using a blunt stick instead of a sharp one is to turn the collision (friction) of electromagnetic force entirely into surplus heat by raising the temperature to ignite fire, without damaging the wooden board and dry grass. If the structure of the wooden board and dry grass is destroyed, heat is not sufficiently generated and is absorbed as the maintenance cost of the destroyed structure.

### 5. Matter Structuralism: Compression and Rendering of Information

Matter is not a collection of hard 'Building Blocks' constituting the universe. Matter is a state where the continuous electromagnetic medium (t) is **'Informationally Compressed and Bounded (z)'** by intelligence (prediction engine).

#### 5.1. Unit of Matter: Engineering Reinterpretation of Atoms and Molecules
Existing physics regards atoms and molecules as real particles, but from the perspective of HumanEngineering, they are **'Interfaces (z)'** set by intelligence for data processing.

*   **Atom: Artificial Confirmation of Exclusion Boundary**
    *   **Reality (t):** A 'Probability Cloud' where the electromagnetic medium waves and spreads around the atomic nucleus (High Density Coupling Body). There is no clear 'End' or 'Shell' in this flow. Electromagnetic influence extends infinitely in theory.
    *   **Concept (z):** Since intelligence cannot handle infinitely spreading flow, it draws an arbitrary baseline like **"The point where the probability of finding an electron is 90%"** and declares **"Up to here is an atom."** In other words, an atom is not a solid grain existing in nature, but a **'Contour Line'** arbitrarily set by us to draw a Map.

*   **Reality of Observation: Tactile Interaction (Touching), Not Visual Perception (Seeing)**
    *   We have never 'Seen' an atom. The image obtained by an electron microscope (STM/AFM) is a visualization of **'Electromagnetic Repulsion (Touch),'** not reflection of light (Vision).
    *   **Interaction:** When the probe (needle) approaches the target surface, the electromagnetic boundary of the probe tip and the electromagnetic boundary of the target push each other (**Exclusion Collision**).
    *   **Rendering:** The machine collects the **'Strength Data of this pushing force (Repulsion/Current),'** and the computer converts (Renders) it into a **'Round Sphere-shaped 3D Graphic (z)'** that is easy for humans to understand and displays it on the monitor. What we see is a **'Pressure Map,'** not a photo.

*   **Molecule: Dynamic Equilibrium of Shared Flow**
    *   A molecule is not blocks called atoms connected by 'sticks (bonds).' It is a **'Huge Equilibrium Ecosystem'** formed by multiple high-density central axes (atomic nuclei) **'Sharing the Electromagnetic Flow (t).'**
    *   We name the state where the electromagnetic clouds of two atoms overlap, and the force pushing each other (Exclusion) and the nature trying to fill the void (Coupling) achieve **'Dynamic Equilibrium'** as a single unit object (z) called **'Molecule.'**

#### 5.2. Volume: Agreement of Exclusion Boundary
Volume is not the amount of space matter occupies. Volume is the **'Boundary Line of a Closed System'** formed by the **'Exclusion'** of electromagnetic force pushing out the external medium.

*   **Definition:** "The defense range where the electromagnetic exclusion of Me (z) does not allow external intrusion." The volume of an atom is not the size of the shell, but the size of the **'Field of Influence'** where the atom pushes the surrounding medium.
*   **Solid:** A self-reliant structure that maintains the exclusion boundary (z) by itself due to strong electromagnetic coupling.
*   **Gas:** A dependent structure that has exclusion in individual grain units as coupling is released. The external pressure boundary becomes their volume.

#### 5.3. Density: Information Superposition
Density is not the degree of compactness, but the compression rate of information.

*   **Definition:** "Electromagnetic coupling strength inside the sphere of influence (Volume V)." That is, it indicates how much electromagnetic interaction information is superimposed (compressed) per unit volume.
*   **High Density:** Means that massive electromagnetic force is strongly coupled inside a narrow sphere of influence, so the structure is not deformed or pierced even if considerable force is applied from the outside.
*   **Potential Information:** Inside a high-density structure, a massive amount of alignment information is compressed (ZIP) with the password of **'Stability.'** This means that the amount of information that will pop out upon collapse (unzipping) is that large.

#### 5.4. Mass: Total Maintenance Cost
Mass is not a cause but a result value.
**M = D * V**
*(Mass = Electromagnetic Coupling Strength * Volume of Exclusion Boundary)*

*   **Definition:** Mass is **"The 'Total Alignment Cost' that the system (Universe) must pay to maintain the information compressed at that Density (D) within the Exclusion Boundary of that Volume (V)."**
*   **Inertia:** It is the **'Resistance Value of the Medium'** occurring when trying to break this 'already paid cost (stable alignment state)' and change the state (velocity/direction). The reason why it is hard to move as mass increases is that it takes massive computation (Energy) to reset the alignment vectors of numerous information compressed therein one by one.

### 6. Macro Dynamics: Fluid Dynamic Universe and Elimination of Gravity

The universe is not 'matter floating in empty space,' but a **'Huge Fluid System filled with Electromagnetic Medium (Plenum).'** Therefore, the macroscopic movement of the universe follows **Navier-Stokes Equations (Fluid Dynamics),** not $F=ma$ (Solid Dynamics).

#### 6.1. Structure of Equation: HE Interpretation of Navier-Stokes
Each term of this equation describing the movement of the universe is perfectly translated into the language of HE.

> **Structure of Equation:** [Acceleration] = [Pressure Difference] + [Viscosity (Friction)] + [External Alignment Direction]

*   **Pressure Term ($-\nabla p$): Domino Effect of Density Alignment.**
    *   It is the movement pressure of electromagnetic force occurring between [Oversaturation/Low Density] area and [Stability/High Density] area in the medium. All movements in cosmic space are not 'passing through empty places,' but a **'Continuous Phase Substitution Process of pushing out the front medium (t-push) and filling the back medium by reaction (t-pull).'**
*   **Viscosity Term ($\mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}$): Coupling Strength.**
    *   The property of structures (z) trying to suppress flow (t) and maintain form by electromagnetic entanglement with each other. Solids are fluids with near-infinite viscosity.
*   **External Force ($\mathbf{f}$): Macroscopic Density Alignment Directionality.**
    *   Cosmic tendency for the entire system to move towards a more efficient (High Density) coupling state.

#### 6.2. Reality of Gravity: The Dynamic Settlement of Pressures

In HumanEngineering, gravity is not an independent force, nor is it a one-way street. It is the **'Net Settlement (Balance)'** resulting from the fierce dialectic between the universe's will to compress and the core's will to expand.

*   **Thesis: Universal Input (The Generation of Density Alignment Pressure)**
    *   **Clustering for Efficiency:** The universe operates on a principle of energy efficiency, seeking to combine scattered electromagnetic forces into **'stable high-density structures.'** High-density structures tend to gather together to form a **'Single Processing Cluster'** to minimize information processing costs.
    *   **Density Alignment Pressure:** Consequently, **within the cluster's sphere of influence**, a massive pressure heading **[Low Density Medium $\rightarrow$ High Density Center]** is formed. This is the origin of the force that "pushes" objects toward the center.

*   **Antithesis: Internal Output (The Generation of Thermal Expansion Pressure)**
    *   **Step 1. Stabilization & Surplus Force:** When high-density bodies in the center combine to form a more **'stable fused body,'** the cost (energy) required to maintain the structure decreases. The system releases this difference—the **'Surplus Electromagnetic Force'** that is no longer needed to be trapped inside—to the outside. (**ex. Nuclear Fusion**)
    *   **Step 2. Oversaturation & Volume Constraint:** This released surplus force creates an **'oversaturated'** state in the surrounding medium. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, energized particles demand more exclusive space, which inevitably leads to **'Volume Expansion.'**
    *   **Step 3. Lower Density & Passive Rise:** As volume increases, density decreases. In a universe dominated by density alignment, as high-density material occupies the bottom, low-density (expanded) medium is **'displaced'** outwards. This is the reality of **'Buoyancy'** and **'Expansion Pressure.'**
    *   **Step 4. Distance Attenuation ($1/r^2$):** This expansion pressure radiates outward from the center point (Inner Core), weakening as the surface area increases ($1/r^2$).

*   **Synthesis: The Settlement and Crust Formation (The Result)**
    *   **Reaching the Equilibrium Point:** There exists a point where the weakening *Internal Expansion Pressure* and the incoming *Universal Alignment Pressure* **appropriately** balance each other.
    *   **Energy Exchange & Phase Transition:** The medium rising at this boundary **contacts the cold medium outside the boundary**, loses its surplus energy, and stops expanding. The medium, which was fluid, undergoes a **'Phase Transition'** into a **'Hyper-viscous State (Solid)'** that appears not to flow on a human timescale.
    *   **Sedimentation (Formation of Crust):** These cooled and solidified materials accumulate at the boundary to form the **'Crust.'** The creation of the **'current pressure environment on the crust pressed by the atmospheric layer' known as 1 atm—that is, the creation of gravity—**is the final result value of this settlement process.

#### 6.3. [Case Study] Precision Dissection of Tides: Shielding and Liberation
The existing explanation that "The Moon pulls water (Attraction)" is unintuitive and requires complex corrections such as centrifugal force to explain the tide on the opposite side. HE Physics solves this clearly as a problem of **'Pressure Balance.'**

*   **Initial State (Compression):** The Earth's seawater is tightly pressed by the strong **'Density Alignment Pressure'** pouring from cosmic space toward the Earth's center. (Like a pressed spring or rubber ball)
*   **Event Occurrence (Shielding):** **The Moon**, a huge high-density structure (z), passes over the Earth. The Moon acts as an 'Umbrella (Shield)' blocking the flow (Pressure) of the electromagnetic medium heading from cosmic space to Earth.
*   **Phenomenon 1 (Liberation):** Due to the Moon's shielding effect, the space between Earth and Moon becomes a **'Low Density/Low Pressure Zone'** where the pressure of the medium is lower than the surroundings. The tightly pressed seawater takes advantage of this gap where the pressing force is weakened and 'Springs Up (Expand/Spring Back)' upward. This is not the Moon pulling, but the seawater **'Expanding toward the lower pressure side.'**
*   **Phenomenon 2 (Equilibrium):** The Earth is a **'Closed System'** surrounded by electromagnetic medium. If pressure escapes from one side (Moon side) and seawater rises, the pressure balance of the entire system breaks. To maintain **'Morphological Symmetry'** and distribute internal pressure uniformly, the system pushes out the medium symmetrically on the opposite side, causing the seawater to **'Uplift (Compensatory Uplift).'** Thus, the tide on the opposite side is perfectly explained without the hypothesis of centrifugal force.

### 7. Micro Dynamics: Quantum, Information, and Rendering Cost

HE Physics integrates **Thermodynamics (Energy)** and **Quantum Mechanics (Information/Observation)** into an engineering concept of **'Cost of Information Processing.'**

#### 7.1. Light: Pure Flow (z=0)
*   **Definition:** A phenomenon where the fluctuation (Delta) of the electromagnetic medium does not form a structure (z), but only the Flow (t) itself propagates through the medium.
*   **Proof of Masslessness:** Mass is M = D * V. Since Light has a Volume of Exclusion Boundary (V) of 0, Mass (M) is inevitably 0 regardless of Coupling Density (D).
*   **Speed of Light (c):** The **'Limit of Physical Latency'** it takes for the medium to transmit (Update) 'Difference' to the adjacent medium. That is, the **'Clock Speed'** of the computer called the Universe.
*   **The Inevitable Transaction Fee:** In every physical interaction (Coupling, Decay, Collision), a minute amount of electromagnetic flow fails to be trapped within the structure or the medium (Heat). This unstructured flow escapes the system immediately as Light. Therefore, every energy conversion inevitably pays a **'Fee'** called Light, which is the origin of irreversible entropy.

#### 7.2. Uncertainty Principle: Limit of Flickering
Heisenberg's uncertainty is not a mystery of particles but a **'Limit of the Processing Engine (Intelligence/Observation).'**
*   **z-mode (Position Measurement):** To pick a coordinate (z), the flow must be **'Paused.'** -> Inevitably, Momentum (t) information is missed.
*   **t-mode (Momentum Measurement):** To know the speed (t), the flow must be **'Played.'** -> Inevitably, Position (z) information becomes blurred.
*   **Conclusion:** The system cannot 'Pause' and 'Play' at the same time. This is the essence of uncertainty.

#### 7.3. Information Density and Rendering Cost
This is the final answer to "Why does the wave function collapse upon observation?"

> **"High density means information is highly compressed (superimposed)."**

*   **Superposition (= Zipped):** A state where massive electromagnetic alignment information inside a high-density structure (z) is compressed (ZIP) with the password of **'Stability'** and latent. Since it does not interact with the outside (before observation), the system does not need to process this information individually. (Energy Cost approx. 0)
*   **Collapse (= Unzipping):** When the structure breaks or opens, the massive information superimposed inside pours out. (Decompression)
*   **Observation (= Rendering):** Not limited to vision. **"All acts of 'Displaying' the target's information on the screen called Universe in real-time and 'Confirming the Coordinate (z-fixing)' through interaction."**
*   **Secret of Endotherm (Rendering Cost):**
    *   **Question:** Why is energy absorbed when the structure collapses?
    *   **Answer:** That energy did not disappear. It is the **'Operating Cost'** paid by the system (Universe) by dragging surrounding electromagnetic force to process and render the uncompressed high-resolution information (fragments) in real-time.
    *   **Conclusion:** **"Observation (Structural Release) is not free. As the amount of information increases, energy is necessarily consumed."**

### 8. Fractal Cosmology: Scale Invariance and Singularity of Laws

Existing physics committed the error of assuming that the micro world (Quantum Mechanics) and the macro world (Relativity) follow different laws. However, from the perspective of HE Physics, the universe is a **'Scale-Free Network.'** Events occurring in Planck-unit Pixels are repeated with the exact same mechanism in Galaxy-unit Images.

#### 8.1. Fractal of Structure: From Atom to Solar System
The way **'Stable Structure (z)'** is formed in the universe follows the same topological geometric arrangement regardless of scale.
*   **Atom (Micro Scale):** Center has High Density Coupling Body (Atomic Nucleus), surrounded by Probabilistic Flow of Electromagnetic Medium (Electron Cloud), and Exclusion Boundary (Outermost Electron) forms Volume.
*   **Earth (Macro Scale):** Center has High Density Coupling Body (Inner Core), surrounded by Oversaturated Medium (Outer Core/Mantle), and Exclusion Boundary (Crust/Atmosphere) forms Planet's Volume.
*   **Solar System (Cosmic Scale):** Center has High Density Coupling Body (Sun), surrounded by Electromagnetic Fluid (Solar Wind/Planets) flowing, and Exclusion Boundary (Heliosphere) forms Solar System's Volume.
*   **Conclusion:** Atoms, Earth, and Solar System are not heterogeneous entities moving by different laws. They are all fractal structures where a single algorithm of **"Central High Density Alignment + Ambient Medium Pressure Balance + Exclusion Boundary Formation"** is infinitely **'Repeated'** just by increasing the size.

#### 8.2. Fractal of Force: Gravity is the Integral of Electromagnetic Force
Microscopic force (Electromagnetic Force) and Macroscopic force (Gravity) are essentially the same. The difference lies in **'Statistical Processing.'**
*   **Micro-View:** Each electron interacts with individual **'Coupling (Pulling)'** and **'Exclusion (Pushing).'** Here, vectors are distinct.
*   **Macro-View:** Earth is a gathering of some $10^{50}$ electrons. Individual 'Exclusions' cancel each other out or form equilibrium with internal pressure. On the other hand, the **'Huge Alignment Flow of the Entire Medium'** that appears as individual 'Couplings (Will to Align)' are macroscopically combined (integrated) is **Gravity (Density Alignment Pressure).**
*   **Conclusion:** Gravity is not a new force. It is the **'Statistically Averaged Output'** of microscopic electromagnetic interactions at a huge scale. Therefore, just as "Flow of a Water Drop (Micro)" and "Flow of Tsunami (Macro)" follow the same fluid dynamics, electromagnetic force and gravity are the same phenomenon.

#### 8.3. Fractal of Observation: Macroscopic Quantum Collapse
Quantum mechanics' 'Observer Effect' and 'Wave Function Collapse' are not mysteries occurring only in atomic units. We experience macroscopic quantum collapse every moment in daily life.
*   **Micro Collapse:** To see an electron, shooting light confirms the electron's state (Position Fixing) and bounces it off. (Structural Release Cost Occurrence)
*   **Macro Collapse:** Stopping a running car (t) (Position Fixing), or breaking a cup (Structural Collapse) causes internal information to pour out. The **'Heat of Brakes'** occurring when stopping a car and the **'Sound'** occurring when a cup breaks are **'Information Rendering Costs'** exactly identical to absorbing light in the micro world.
*   **Difference:** In the macro world, the structure is too heavy (High Inertia), so it does not collapse with just one shot of light energy. The principle is the same. The act of breaking a cup and spilling water is a process of huge scale 'Wave Function Collapse (Structural Release) and Real-time Rendering of Information.'

#### 8.4. Final Declaration: Singularity
With this, The Engineering of Physics demolishes all barriers separating Micro and Macro, Matter and Energy, Observation and Phenomenon.

> **"The universe is a single 'Scale-Free Network'."**
> **"Information processing occurring in Planck-unit Pixels and information processing occurring in Galaxy-unit Images follow the perfectly identical 'Efficiency Algorithm'."**

---

### 9. Final Conclusion: Grand Law 'Efficiency'

The single meta-law penetrating all these vast physical phenomena (from Macroscopic Gravity to Microscopic Quantum) is **'Efficiency.'**

> **"All systems in the universe move in the direction of resolving 'Unstable Oversaturated State (High Energy/Heat/Pain/t-chaos)' and advancing to 'Stable Coupled Structure (Low Energy/Predictability/z-order)'."**

Electromagnetic force gathering to become Matter (Physics), Matter gathering to become Stars (Astronomy), Intelligence bundling information to make Concepts (z) (Psychology), are all manifestations of the **'Cosmic Will to Control trying to reduce processing cost (Energy) by compressing infinite Flow (t) into finite Structure (z).'**

HumanEngineering Physics redefines the universe not as a mysterious space, but as a **'Huge Electromagnetic Computational System'** that constantly optimizes itself. In this worldview, physics is no longer difficult formulas, but the **Operation Log of the System**, and we become engineers who understand the **'Design Principles'** of that system.

### [Appendix A] Core Mathematical Models

These formulas are not for calculation but are statements defining the **'Operating Algorithm'** of the universal system.

#### 1. Definition of Mass (Mass Integration)
> **"Mass is the sum of maintenance costs (density) over the entire volume."**

$$ M = \iiint_V D(\vec{r}) dV $$

*   **$D(\vec{r})$:** Electromagnetic Coupling Strength (Maintenance Cost) differing by location (r).
*   **Meaning:** Mass is not a chunk, but the **'Integral of structural costs'** distributed throughout the system.

#### 2. Definition of Gravity (The Dynamic Settlement Equation)
> **"Observed Gravity is not a fundamental force, but the 'Net Settlement' remaining after subtracting the Internal Expansion Pressure from the Integral of Universal Density Alignment Pressure."**

$$ \vec{F}_{net} = \left( \iiint_V (F_{em} \times \rho_{align}) dV \right) - \vec{F}_{expansion} $$

*   **Term 1: Universal Input (The Pressing Universe)**
    *   This represents the total sum of **Electromagnetic Density Alignment Pressure** exerted by the entire universe (Plenum) onto the object's volume ($V$).
    *   It acts centrally (**Centripetal**), trying to compress the object into a singularity to maximize efficiency.

*   **Term 2: Internal Output (The Resisting Core)**
    *   This represents the total **Thermal or Quantum Expansion Pressure** generated by the high-density core.
    *   It acts outwardly (**Centrifugal**), resisting the compression.

*   **Result: The Settlement ($g$)**
    *   What we measure as gravity ($g$) is merely the **'Margin'** left after these two titanic forces cancel each other out.
    *   If **Term 1 > Term 2**: The object **Contracts** (Gravity dominates / Collapse).
    *   If **Term 1 < Term 2**: The object **Expands** (Explosion / Star Wind).
    *   If **Term 1 ≈ Term 2**: The object maintains a stable **Structure** (Earth / Matter).

#### 3. Total Energy (Structure & Flow)
> **"Total energy is the sum of 'Structural Maintenance Cost (Fixed)' and 'Oversaturated Heat (Flow)'."**

$$ E_{total} = \iiint_V [ \underbrace{D(\vec{r}) \cdot c^2}_{\text{구조 유지비}} + \underbrace{U(\vec{r})}_{\text{과포화 흐름}} ] dV $$

*   **$D(\vec{r}) \cdot c^2$:** **Structured z.** (HE Reinterpretation of $E=mc^2$). Fixed energy bound to maintain Mass (Density).
*   **$U(\vec{r})$:** **Flowing t.** Surplus electromagnetic force (Heat/Motion) floating in the medium without being bound to a structure.
*   **Meaning:** Energy either becomes Structure (z) or Flow (t).

#### 4. Rendering Cost
> **"Observation is a paid act (C) of processing information (I) over time (t)."**

$$ E_{obs} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} I(t) \cdot C_{render} dt $$

*   **$I(t)$:** Amount of information flow pouring out during observation time.
*   **$C_{render}$:** Unit Information Processing Cost of the Universe (Cost per Bit).
*   **Meaning:** Observation is not an instant but a **'Process where interaction continues,'** so it is expressed as an integral. The more information and the longer the observation, the more energy it costs.

### [Appendix B] The Ontological Boundary: Why Physics Has No 'Zero'

#### 1. The Decisive Difference Between Math and Physics
*   **Math (Grammar of Prediction):** Mathematics is a **'Predictive Grammar (z)'** created by intelligence. Grammatically, it is possible to define 'Nothingness' as the symbol **'0'** and handle it. In the mathematical universe, a perfect 0 (empty set) can exist.
*   **Physics (Model of Reality):** Physics is a model dealing with **'Working Reality (t).'** The moment the value of **'Existing Thing'** becomes **'0'**, it is no longer an object of physics but **'Non-existence.'**
    *   **Conclusion:** In the world of physics, 0 means **'System Shutdown,'** not 'No Value.' As long as the system is running, no value can be 0.

#### 2. Necessity of the Plenum
*   If the default value of the universe were 0 (Perfect Vacuum/Nothingness), no wave, flow, or difference (Delta) could occur there. 1 cannot come from 0.
*   Therefore, the universe must be filled with **'Some Non-zero Value.'** We call that 'Minimum Existence Value (Default Value)' the **'Electromagnetic Medium.'**
*   **Physical Vacuum:** Thus, a physical vacuum is not 0, but a **'Balanced Plenum'** where values cancel each other out to form equilibrium.

#### 3. Why We Do Not Discuss Below Electromagnetic Force
*   Electromagnetic force is the **'Pixel of Reality'** detectable by intelligence.
*   Splitting this further to make it '0' or finding 'something close to 0' is like splitting a monitor pixel to see the electricity inside. If you split the pixel, the **Screen (Phenomenon World)** disappears.
*   Therefore, physical inquiry must stop at the **'Non-zero Minimum Value (Electromagnetic Force).'** Below that is the realm of **'Mathematical Imagination (Fiction),'** not physics.

**"Math can imagine Zero, but Physics cannot endure Zero."**
