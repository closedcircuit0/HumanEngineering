# The Engineering of Power

### Why All Our Stories End in a Fistfight: A Universal Framework for Analyzing Agency and Influence.

#### Preface: The Invisible Rule of All Stories

Consider the stories we consume—novels, comics, dramas, and films. Have you ever noticed a strange, unspoken rule? No matter how sublime the ideas ("love," "justice," "peace") or how complex the ideological conflicts, why does the climax of every story ultimately boil down to a single, brutal question: **"Who is stronger?"**

Why do noble dialogues end in fistfights, and sophisticated arguments conclude with physical destruction? Why must a character's ideal be proven "right" only when their adversary is physically defeated? Is this merely a compromise for entertainment, a simple dramatic device? Or does it reveal a fundamental law of humanity and narrative that we would rather ignore?

This 'logic of power' is not confined to fiction. We find it engraved in the very structure of our language, everywhere. "The power of man," "the power of nature," "the power of logic," "the power of money." Why does the label "the power of..." attach itself to almost every concept, magically transforming it into something we can measure, compare, and compete with?

This report argues that this is no coincidence. This paper proposes a universal framework for analyzing this phenomenon by redefining 'power' not as an objective entity, but as an **'instrumental perspective' that emerges the moment The Self perceives a phenomenon as a 'means' to impose its narrative onto reality.**

Through this single principle, we will dissect why all stories must ultimately end with the logic of power, and how that same logic operates in the real world, from the laws of physics to the deepest corners of the human mind. This is the first principle of the final HumanEngineering framework.

#### Chapter 1: The Boundary Between Phenomenon and Power

To understand power, we must first draw a clear, sharp line between the world as it is and the world as we interpret it. This boundary is precisely where power is born.

**1.1. Phenomenon: Irreplaceable Sensory Data**

A phenomenon is the pure flow of ‘change (Δ)’ data, uninterpreted, that is directly input into our sensory organs. It is the falling of an apple, the flow of water, or the nameless lump in one’s throat.

The core attribute of a phenomenon is its irreplaceability. The sensory data of a falling apple is, for the person who witnesses it, an undeniable primary reality. We cannot argue it out of existence. It simply is. This is the only reality we have direct contact with, the 'Foundational Reality.'

**1.2. Power: A Substitutable Explanatory Narrative**

Power, on the other hand, is the **'story (narrative)'** and **'theory'** that our Self creates to explain 'why' that irreplaceable phenomenon occurred. It is the invisible mechanism we posit to understand observable change.

The core attribute of power is its substitutability. A single narrative is never the only possible story. It can always be replaced by a "better alternative narrative"—one that is more elegant, more predictive, or more useful. The very fact that an alternative narrative can exist proves that the original was also just a narrative.

*(This report does not simply mean ‘story’ by ‘narrative.’ It refers to all kinds of interpretative systems we create to explain and predict reality, such as scientific theories, philosophical arguments, and political ideologies.)*

**1.3. The 'Gravity' Case Study: A Concept Becomes Power at Birth**

This distinction becomes stark when we analyze the concept of 'gravity.'

The fall of an apple is a phenomenon. It is an irreplaceable sensory experience.

But 'gravity' is not a phenomenon. No one has ever seen, touched, or felt 'gravity' directly. 'Gravity' is a powerful narrative created by The Self to explain the 'why' behind the falling apple, the orbiting planet, and the flowing river. The moment Newton named the invisible cause of this pattern 'gravity' (a pulling force), he was no longer describing a phenomenon. He was creating a powerful tool to explain and predict reality.

Therefore, the concept of 'gravity' was **already 'power' from the moment of its birth**. It is the story we tell to make the world understandable and, ultimately, controllable.

#### Chapter 2: The First Principle — The Mechanism of ‘Substitution’

If power is a narrative created to explain a phenomenon, what is the fundamental mechanism that drives this creation? Why does The Self insist on translating the world into the language of 'power'?

**2.1. The Emergence of the Instrumental Perspective: "Is This Useful?"**

As established in 'The Engineering of the Self,' the fundamental goal of The Self is the expansion of its own narrative, including survival. To achieve this absolute goal, The Self has an inherent tendency to evaluate every phenomenon in the world through a single, pragmatic question:

"How useful is this to my narrative?"

This is the **'instrumental perspective.'** The moment this perspective is applied, the pure phenomenon of a 'falling apple' is re-perceived as useful information "to understand and predict for my survival," and the pure state of 'love' is re-perceived as a useful resource "to maintain my emotional stability and expand my relationships." The phenomenon loses its intrinsic nature and its status is changed to that of a 'means' or a **'tool.'**

**2.2. Substitution into 'Power': The Birth of a Universal Unit of Calculation**

'Power' is the universal **'unit of calculation'** that The Self uses to measure, compare, and compute **'utility'** in order to calculate risk/return for its current highest value. The moment The Self perceives a phenomenon as a tool, the label of 'power' is attached to gauge the tool's efficacy. This process of 'substitution' is not a simple shift in perspective; it is a fundamental act that constitutes our perception of reality itself.

The 'substitution' has already begun the moment a 'concept' is created. We create the narrative that "mass pulls mass" to understand the phenomenon of a 'falling apple' and name its core mechanism 'gravity.' This narrative of 'pulling' is already a framework of power. In other words, we do not see a phenomenon and then 'change' our thinking to power; rather, we use the logic of power from the very first step of creating a concept to understand the phenomenon.

All explanatory systems we create (theories, ideologies, concepts) are, in essence, 'substitutable narratives,' which is precisely the definition of 'power' from Chapter 1. Therefore, the universality of substitution is not a mere linguistic habit but a logical consequence derived from the first principle of this framework.

This substitution is widely applied, extending beyond the internal world and social relationships to interactions with physical reality, in the following three main types:

*   **Type 1: The Power to Overcome ‘Environmental Resistance’ (Physical/Natural Power)**
    *   **Phenomenon:** A stone is heavy and does not move. The ground is hard and difficult to dig.
    *   **Substitution:** My will and action to overcome this resistance are substituted into 'physical power.' "Moving the stone" is an act of power that "imposes my narrative (the stone should be over there) onto physical reality." All our theoretical concepts about natural phenomena, such as 'gravity' and 'friction,' are also substitutions into power, aimed at understanding and overcoming (or utilizing) this resistance. This is directly linked to the attempt by The Self, as discussed in 'The Engineering of the Body,' to overcome the constraints of physical reality (the hardware).

*   **Type 2: The Power to Defeat an ‘Adversary’ (Competitive/Antagonistic Power)**
    *   **Phenomenon:** Another person makes a different argument or obstructs the achievement of my goal.
    *   **Substitution:** The attempt to resolve this conflict and impose my narrative is substituted into 'power.' This can be physical violence ('combat power'), logical persuasion ('the power of logic'), or capital advantage ('the power of money'). This is the manifestation of a 'narrative war' between two Selves with different 'hierarchies of values,' as analyzed in 'The Principle of Human Action.'

*   **Type 3: The Power to Handle ‘Complex Internal/Social Worlds’ (Abstract/Conceptual Power)**
    *   **Phenomenon:** A nameless flow of physiological changes (a shift in heart rate, stimulation of the lacrimal glands, a sense of lethargy) arises, social norms exist, and relationships of love are formed.
    *   **Substitution:** Even these abstract phenomena are substituted into ‘power’ the moment they are perceived as a means to impose our narrative. This is the most sophisticated form of power, which attempts to ‘synchronize’ with others by embedding ‘intent (narrative)’ into an ‘empty vessel (concept),’ as discussed in ‘The Engineering of Language.’ The process of this substitution is as follows:
        *   **Emotion:** A pure internal feedback narrative that defines this pattern of physiological changes as a signal for ‘loss’ and names it ‘sadness.’
            *   → **The Power of Emotion:** The same narrative of ‘sadness’ is now regarded as a ‘means’ to gain empathy from others or to justify one’s own actions.
        *   **Justice:** An abstract concept about fairness (a Third-Order strategic value).
            *   → **The Power of Justice:** The same concept is now wielded as a ‘means’ to rally allies, delegitimize enemies, and enforce a specific social order.
        *   **Love:** A state of deep connection and attachment.
            *   → **The Power of Love:** The same state is now used as a ‘means’ to demand sacrifice or overcome adversity.

**2.3. The Antagonistic Nature of Power: No Resistance, No Power**

'Power' is never born in a vacuum. It is a concept that presupposes resistance. A 'means' is only necessary when there is an obstacle to overcome. This obstacle could be another person's narrative, the inertia of physical reality, or the limits of one's own past.

Therefore, power is inherently a concept of comparison and conflict. It becomes visible and meaningful only when one narrative competes against another, or against the stubborn silence of reality. If there is no resistance, there is no power.

#### Chapter 3: The Dynamics of Power — Creation, Spectrum, and Circulation

Power is not static. It is created, manifested in various forms, and constantly circulates and changes.

**3.1. The Creation and Accumulation of Power**

*   **The Creation of Power (Resources and Frames):** Where does power come from? First, from **'resources' (money, information, technology, etc.)** that can be directly injected into an adversary's risk-reward equation. Second, and more fundamentally, from the ability to control the **'story'** itself that interprets reality—that is, the ability of **'frame control.'**
*   **The Accumulation of Power (Self-Reinforcing Loop):** Power begets power. More resources create a stronger frame, and a stronger frame attracts more resources.

**3.2. The Spectrum of Power and Its Origin: The Artificial Reversal of Efficiency**

Power, using its created resources and frames, manifests across a diverse spectrum, from direct intervention in the hardware (body/environment) to indirect intervention in the OS (The Self). This spectrum, however, appears as a continuous form rather than a clearly divided one. **But this spectrum and the 'rules of efficiency' within it did not arise naturally. They are the result of a deliberate redesign by a stronger power (the collective) to control a more primal power (the individual's physical force).**

**In the state of nature, the quickest and most certain path is direct physical coercion that threatens the First-Order value (survival). But a civilized system, to prevent a 'war of all against all' where every individual uses this primal power, establishes a fundamental social contract: 'the limitation of power by power.' In other words, a larger collective power (the 'group') prohibits and punishes the use of physical force by individuals, thereby artificially reversing the most efficient power into the most 'inefficient' (highest-risk) power.**

Due to this fundamental redesign, power is now divided into two qualitatively different games, depending on the target.

*   **Game 1: Against Nature/Objects (The World of Primal Efficiency)**
    *   When the target of power is not another Self (another person) but a resisting physical reality (nature, objects), power still operates in its most primal form. There is no larger system of power to limit my power here. Therefore, in this domain, **direct physical coercion (hard power) remains the most effective and efficient path.**
    *   *(e.g., Technological environmental change and pioneering):* Building a dam to change the course of a river or inventing a new tool to increase productivity is the most direct and efficient exercise of power to impose one's narrative on the target, nature. Attempting to 'persuade' or 'negotiate' with nature is meaningless.

*   **Game 2: Against Humans (The World of Designed Inefficiency)**
    *   However, when the target of power is another Self, we must play the game within the **'list of permitted powers'** that unfolds upon this 'designed inefficiency.'
        *   **(Strong) Hard Power (Direct Coercion):**
            *   The most extreme end of the spectrum. It physically eliminates the other's possibility of choice.
            *   *(e.g., violence, confinement, "grabbing the opponent's hand to force a signature")*
            *   **Systemic Constraint:** Within a social system, an individual's act of hard power must bear the highest risk (punishment), so it is used only in extremely exceptional situations. In contrast, the state 'monopolizes' this power to maintain the system.
        *   **(Intermediate Zone: Various Means)**
            *   Between hard power and soft power, there exist countless means that mix coercion and induction. These are the limited forms of coercion permitted by the system. Listed from stronger to weaker, they are as follows:
                *   **Restriction of action and punishment by the force of rules (law, institutions):** Structurally limiting the range of choices by prohibiting or punishing certain actions, backed by physical force.
                *   **Restriction of means of survival (economic pressure):** Strongly pressuring the other to perform a certain action by controlling resources essential for their survival (money, food, jobs).
                *   **Forcing a choice and threat (intimidation):** Distorting the other's calculation and forcing a choice by presenting a serious future loss ('expected loss'), without directly using physical force.
                *   **Direct provision and transaction of desired resources (buyout, negotiation):** Inducing the other to voluntarily cooperate with my narrative by directly providing them with an 'expected gain.'
                *   **Request for help (appeal):** Appealing to the other's hierarchy of values ('The Extended Self' or 'Ethics'), making them believe that helping me is a way to strengthen their own narrative.
        *   **(Weak) Soft Power (Indirect Induction):**
            *   The most sophisticated end of the spectrum. It guides the other's 'prediction-error calculation' process to make them choose what I want 'on their own.' This is the safest form of power, most recommended by the system.
            *   *(e.g., persuasion, education, media, authority, charm, art, empathy)*

Ultimately, all the sophisticated powers we use every day—persuasion, negotiation, transaction, appeal—are, in fact, **'workarounds' that we were forced to develop in a situation where the most efficient path (physical force) was blocked by a greater power.** Just as bacteria that have become resistant to a powerful antibiotic evolve entirely different metabolic pathways to survive, the entirety of human civilization and social technology can be said to be a tearful and great history of adaptation, which blossomed upon this fundamental constraint.

**3.3. The Circulation and Collapse of Power: Three Paths to Collapse**

Power is not eternal. Every system of power, over time, faces three kinds of paths that inevitably lead to its weakening and dissolution.

*   **Path 1: External Competition (The Challenge of an Alternative Narrative):** The most obvious cause of collapse. A **'better alternative narrative'** emerges—one that is more attractive, more efficient, or better explains reality—and erodes the legitimacy of the existing power, eating away at its base of support. Power must continuously prove its superiority in this constant competition to survive.

*   **Path 2: Detachment from Reality (Narrative Isolation):** This occurs when a system refuses new 'prediction-error' feedback from reality and settles within its own success narrative. It fails to detect changes in the external world, and its 'map' no longer aligns with the 'territory,' gradually becoming detached from reality. This **'narrative isolation'** turns the system into an inflexible fossil, making it easily breakable even with small environmental changes.

*   **Path 3: Self-Destruction (The Contradiction of the Narrative):** The most cunning and unavoidable cause of collapse. This is the phenomenon where the **'logical contradiction'** inherent in the core narrative that sustains the system of power gradually becomes prominent and deepens over time. For example, when a narrative that advocates 'equality for all' actually results in the concentration of power in a tiny minority, or when a narrative that insists on 'one solidarity' suppresses the diverse voices within, that power loses the trust of its internal members without an external enemy and collapses by cracking on its own.

*(More detailed historical examples of these paths to collapse—for instance, the collapse of a particular ideological system—would be a good exercise for the reader to explore by applying this framework.)*

#### Chapter 4: The Wisdom of Power — How to Use the Map, and Its Dangers

Having understood the mechanism of power, we must now turn our gaze to the user of that power, which is ourselves. The greatest danger of power lies not in external enemies, but in our internal 'self-deception.'

**4.1. Substitution into Power: An Instinctive Calculation**

Humans are beings who constantly calculate 'Risk/Return.' To perform this calculation, it is essential and natural for The Self to **'substitute'** all the phenomena of the world into the universal unit of calculation called **'power.'** "How much 'power' is needed to move that stone?", "How much 'power' is needed to persuade that person?" All of this is the most fundamental operational process for survival and narrative expansion. Therefore, the perspective of power is not a flaw, but the most basic mode of operation that The Self possesses.

**4.2. The Dangers of Power: Blind Spots and Fusion**

However, there are two inevitable dangers in using this powerful and instinctive lens of 'power.' A wise user 'recognizes' the existence of these dangers and constantly monitors when their tool is about to devour them.

*   **The First Danger - The Blind Spot:** The perspective of 'power,' by its very definition, erases the **'essence (what it is)'** of all the phenomena of the world, and makes us see only the **'utility (what it's for).'** 'Love' is in danger of being reduced to a 'means for emotional stability,' and 'truth' to a 'means to make the opponent submit.' This is the unavoidable price that comes with the overwhelming utility of power.

*   **The Second Danger - Fusion with the Tool:** The greater danger is that the user forgets the very fact that they are using the tool called 'power' and identifies themselves with the tool. This is a form of **'Self-Model Fusion'** described in The Engineering of the Self. The user comes to identify the 'power of justice (the tool)' they wield with their 'just self (The Self).' In this state of 'fusion with the tool,' all criticism of the tool is perceived as an attack on The Self, so the **'Firewall (Stubbornness)'** operates fiercely to reject any reflective feedback.

**4.3. The Wisdom of Power: Not for Control, but for Understanding**

What, then, is the wisdom of power? It is not an inward-looking moral code to be wary of and control 'my power.' It is an outward-looking **'metacognition'** to understand the **'world'** more deeply and accurately.

True wisdom is the ability to read what kind of **'Power Dynamics'** are operating behind all the phenomena that come to me—the words of others, social pressure, natural disasters.

"Why is that person saying such things?" → "What kind of 'power' is he using now, and what 'narrative' of his is he trying to impose on me?"
"Why does society demand this of me?" → "What narrative is the 'power of the system' that governs this society based on, and what risk/reward is it forcing me to calculate?"
"Why do I want to act this way?" → "What 'power of emotion' or 'power of instinct' operating within me is driving this action to protect what core narrative of mine?"

**4.4. The Utility of Power: The Possibility of Diverse Interpretations**

When we come to see the 'influence of power' that moves the world more broadly through this **'map'** of a framework, we can finally choose strategically how to respond to that power.

There is no single correct answer for how to measure power, how to use it, or how to control it. It is interpreted and decided in various ways, entirely depending on **'my narrative'** and **'my goals.'**

*   Some will choose to fight against that power.
*   Some will choose to use that power for their own purposes.
*   Some will choose to avoid the flow of that power.

The wisdom of power does not teach us the 'right action.' It only provides us with a **'map of the battlefield,'** so that we can play our own game with a more **'clear Awareness.'**

#### Conclusion: The Navigator with the Map in Hand

We began this exploration with the question of the strange universality of the word 'power.' And at the end of that journey, we discovered that power is not a mysterious entity that exists in the world, but the most fundamental **'lens'** and **'unit of calculation'** used by our own Self's deepest nature—to understand, predict, and change the world according to its will.

This is an uncomfortable truth. The moment we see the world through this lens, the pure 'phenomenon' is substituted into a 'means' for our narrative. 'Love' becomes 'the power of love,' and 'truth' becomes 'the power of truth.' We stop seeing the world as it is and become beings who constantly calculate 'how to use it.' This is an unavoidable, instinctive mode of operation that The Self possesses.

But at the same time, this opens up immense possibilities for us.

This framework called 'The Engineering of Power' does not give us moral guidance or the 'right path.' It provides something far more valuable and practical. That is, a **'Map.'**

This map shows us by what rules this great 'game of power' that we live in operates. It allows us to read what narrative lies behind the actions of others, how the social structure coerces our choices, and what powers are conflicting within ourselves.

With this map in hand, you are no longer a blind traveler, drifting in the unpredictable storm of the world. You become a **'Navigator'** who reads the currents beyond the fog, predicts the direction of the wind, and determines your own path by grasping the routes of other ships.

The navigator cannot stop the storm. He cannot change the direction of the wind. The only power he has is the very **'Awareness'** that he understands all these 'power dynamics.'

And right within that 'Awareness,' he chooses where to steer his ship. No one can guarantee whether that choice will succeed or fail. But to know that one's own choice is being made within what great flow of power.

That is the only, and the greatest, 'dignity' that HumanEngineering allows a human being to possess.
