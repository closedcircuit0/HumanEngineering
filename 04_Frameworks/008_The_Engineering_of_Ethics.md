# The Engineering of Ethics

## A Physics of Awareness and Settlement

> **“Good and evil are not morality. They are merely the state variables of a system: Deception or Awareness.”**

### Preface: Ethics is Function, Not Imperative

For millennia, humanity has been taught that ethics is a matter of "what ought to be." Philosophy preaches moral imperatives, and religion speaks of divine commandments. **In engineering terms, however, an 'imperative' without a 'functional purpose' does not exist.**

The information processing system we call a 'human being' has two ultimate goals: **'Survival'** and **'Narrative Expansion (Self-Actualization).'** However, these goals are impossible to achieve in isolation; the system must inevitably interact with the uncertain variable known as **'The Other.'** Ethics is nothing more than the optimization protocol designed to control the cost of collision in this process and maximize the probability of survival by increasing the system's **'predictability.'**

This report redefines ethics not as a moral plea, but as a computational process that the system must inevitably perform for survival and coexistence.

### 1. Why Ethics and Morality Are Ambiguous

We lose our way in the face of ethical dilemmas not because we are 'evil,' but because we lump distinct layers of concepts under the single word 'ethics.' For clear system design, we must separate them with high resolution.

*   **Empathy (Emotional Reaction):** The phenomenon where my biological hardware resonates (**z-axis**) with the pain signals (**xy-axis**) of another.
*   **Norms/Morality (Social Rules):** Rules downloaded from the outside to maintain the order of a specific group. They act as **Internalized Power**.
*   **Conscience (Individual Alarm):** A self-censorship alarm that operates according to internalized norms.

Traditional ethics confuses these three. System errors occur when one violates a norm but feels no pang of conscience, or when one feels empathy but it contradicts the norm.

Furthermore, current **Morality** is merely a mass of **'prejudices and stubbornness based on a hierarchy of values'**—the ego of social ethics. Once ethics is redefined, morality is also relationally re-established. Morality is merely a subsystem and reference data for ethics.

The **HumanEngineering (HE)** framework removes this ambiguity by redefining ethics not as compliance with external rules, but as a matter of **'internal computational integrity.'**

### 2. The Physics of Coexistence: Why Start from Reality?

Conventional ethics starts with the abstract proposition, "Live virtuously." But HE asks, "Where does that imperative come from?" All ethics begins not in abstraction, but in **'Physical Reality.'**

The reason is clear. The Self's first bias is that **"I am a being who owns and controls a physical body,"** and the Other is also a being who possesses physical force that can threaten my physical survival. The collision of these two results not in an abstract idea, but in the physical consequences of **'Pain'** and **'Destruction.'** Therefore, the first question of ethics is not morality, but survival: **"How can I live in this physical world without being destroyed?"**

#### 2.1. The Definition of The Other: An Unpredictable Black Box
From the perspective of HE's Zeroth Axiom, 'Focus,' the Other is, before being a 'neighbor,' a **'Vast Uncertainty (Chaos)'** beyond my control and a being with **'Physical Force'** capable of permanently terminating my First-Order Value (Survival).

#### 2.2. The Engineering of Violence: A Vector of Energy
The most primal tool for controlling this chaos is **'Violence.'** Engineering-wise, violence is not evil, but an **'Energy Vector'**.

> Violence is defined as the intentional use of physical force or psychological energy to nullify System B’s autonomy and coercively impose System A’s narrative.

Among these, physical violence is the most efficient as it directly forces the opponent's First-Order Value (survival). In a social system where physical violence is suppressed by the mechanics of power, various forms of psychological violence become efficient means.

#### 2.3. The Birth of Rights: A Ceasefire Agreement
In the natural state of 'the war of all against all,' violence is extremely **'energy-inefficient (high cost)'** for all systems. Therefore, each system enters into a **'Ceasefire Agreement'** stating **"We will not destroy each other"** to lower its own survival costs. This is **'Rights.'**
*   **Condition of Transaction:** If the Control gained (C) is less than the Responsibility/Risk incurred (R), or if the damage is **'Irreversible'** (like death) even if small, the transaction is void, and a mutual non-aggression pact is formed.
*   **Essence:** Rights are not a God-given gift. Rights are a **'Mutual Non-Aggression Pact'** that arises when it is physically/socially proven that **"if you treat me poorly, you will also suffer loss."** The moment the balance of power collapses, rights evaporate.

### 3. What is Ethics? : System Integrity

On this physical foundation, what is the **'Correct Computation'** that an individual system must perform? HE defines ethics as follows:

> **Ethics = Awareness**
> : The un-falsified processing and ledgering of Input (Desire), Output (Action), and Feedback (Result/Cost) **without a single omission or distortion.**

*   **Unethical State (Error):** Acting because I wanted A (my peace), but manipulating the causal data to say "It was for B (your happiness)" when the result is bad (Falsification).
*   **Ethical State (Normal):** Admitting that I acted because I wanted A, and paying the cost (responsibility/blame) when the result differs from the prediction.

Ethics is not about doing good deeds. **Ethics is about not deceiving one's own calculation process.**

### 4. The Distinction Between Good and Evil: Awareness vs. Deception

According to this definition, traditional concepts of good and evil are discarded and replaced by new engineering criteria.

#### 4.1. Evil = Deception/Ignorance of Self
This is not 'unable to do because of not knowing.' It is a **state of active refusal to know (Willful Blindness)**, and further, a **state of forcing oneself to believe a lie as truth.**
The core mechanism of this deception is **'Objectification.'**

*   **Mechanism of Objectification:** Why does a predator feel no pang of conscience (internal alarm)? Because he manipulates his perception to see the Other not as a 'System' like himself, but as an **'Object'**—an entity incapable of billing him for the cost—which removes the feedback loop that would trigger conscience.
*   **Case (Predator):** A criminal checks CCTV before a crime. This is proof that he knows his action is 'forbidden.' However, he objectifies the Other and creates a false narrative like **"because the opponent was wrong"** to justify his ignorance.
*   **Case (Bystander):** Bystanding is not simply "because it's unrelated to me." Usually, bystanding is the result of a risk/return calculation where Responsibility (R) is greater than the Action (C), leading to the **choice of omission (as a form of action)**. However, when this fact is justified by self-destructive logic like **"I will not be harmed in the future"** or **"I hope others wouldn't help me if I were in danger,"** he is deceiving himself.

#### 4.2. Good = Awareness/Honesty with Self
The state of facing one's desires and limitations as they are, and accepting the responsibility that comes with choices. Being aware that helping others is an act for oneself. Even if one commits a crime, if one says, "I committed a crime because there was no other way for my revenge. I will accept the punishment," he is systemically **'Honest (Good).'**
*   **Note:** However, **ethical goodness (Awareness) does not mitigate 'ethical responsibility' (Liability).** It only means that the internal system does not fall into imbalance. External physical causality (punishment) operates as is.

#### 4.3. Deep Dive: The Ultimate Deception — 'The Externalization of Conscience'

There is a sophisticated form of deception often found in 'intelligent predators.' They seem to accept the cost of their actions by saying, "I don't care what happens to my body" or "I accept the prison sentence." However, this is often a flagrant **'Accounting Fraud.'**

*   **Mechanism of Self-Objectification:**
    The system deliberately downgrades its own physical body from 'The Self' to a 'Disposable Tool.' By objectifying their own body, they block the feedback loop of pain or fear regarding their own punishment.

*   **The Offshore Account Strategy (Externalization):**
    Simultaneously, they entrust their 'True Self' (Capacity for pain, Conscience, Core Values) to an **'Extended Self'**—usually their family or a specific loved one. Like a corrupt CEO hiding assets in an **Offshore Account** to avoid bankruptcy liability, they hide their soul in this external safe-box to remain emotionally invulnerable while committing crimes.

*   **The Failure of Symmetry:**
    When such a person destroys another's 'Family' (The victim's Core Value) and offers their own 'Body' (The perpetrator's Tool) as payment, Symmetry is violated.
    > **The Trade:** `[Victim's Core] ≠ [Perpetrator's Tool]`

*   **The Verification:**
    The true 'Settlement' occurs only when the perpetrator's 'Extended Self' (their family) is threatened. **Their mask falls and their true suffering begins only when the retribution reaches this external sanctuary.** If they react with shock or rage at this prospect, it proves that their previous acceptance of responsibility was a lie. They were attempting to pay a debt of 'Gold' with 'Dirt.'

---

### 5. The Golden Rule and Settlement: Verification Algorithms

There are two key tools to verify if a system has fallen into deception.

#### 5.1. The Golden Rule (Symmetry Test)
"Can I tolerate it if others do to me what I do to others?"
The 'Golden Rule,' a wisdom handed down from ancient times, is not a 'fixed truth' but a **'working process itself.'** Thus, it can be utilized as a diachronic and universal verification tool.
*   **Verification:** If one says, "I want to hit, but I hate being hit," this is an **'Asymmetry'** where Input (Desire) and Output (Permission) contradict. This unbalanced energy inevitably leads to internal deception and external violence.
*   **Application:** If a person advocating for the censorship of virtual sexual content like AI does not agree that **"others may also censor my virtual violent tastes,"** he is not being ethical but merely enforcing his tastes through power.

#### 5.2. Settlement (Reality Testing)
"When the result of an action differs from the prediction (Prediction-Error), do I pay the **'Cost'**?"
*   **The Essence of Reality Testing:** **Reality Testing *is* the Confirmation of Power.** If my prediction (will) fails against the resistance of reality, it is proof that the power of reality was stronger. Ethics is admitting the cost of that defeat.
*   **Case (White Lie):** A doctor lied to a patient out of good will. But the patient later resents it, saying, "Why did you deceive me!"
    *   **Deception:** "It was for your peace." (Cost Avoidance)
    *   **Awareness:** "I’m sorry. I misjudged because I dreaded having to watch you in agony if I told the truth. I will accept the blame." (Cost Payment)
*   **Conclusion:** The measure of ethics is not the 'good intention' at the time of action, but the **'Capacity to Accept Responsibility'** at the time of settlement.

### 6. The Expansion of Self-Interest : Altruism

Where, then, does the act of helping others (Altruism) come from? **This is not sacrifice. It is the expansion of self-interest's computational range** into the Time Axis (t) and the Structural Axis (z).

> **Total Altruism = (t-axis: Future Investment) + (z-axis: Current Pain Relief)**

#### 6.1. Expansion of Time Axis (t): Investor
"The act of helping others now is an **Investment** that increases the probability that I, or my **Extended Self (family, etc.)**, will be helped in a crisis in the future." This is paying an insurance premium to maintain the infrastructure called 'Trust Society.' **Therefore, 'Ignorance' of future costs is not a valid excuse; it is a failure of Intelligence (Low Computational Horizon) unable to simulate the t-axis.**

#### 6.2. Expansion of Structural Axis (z): Resonator
This is not a choice, but a matter of **'Rendering Compatibility'** and **'Automatic Simulation.'**
*   **Mechanism (The Engineering of Empathy):** When another's pain data (screams, blood: xy-axis) is input, if the target is recognized as a **'system like mine'**, my simulator (z-Mode) automatically operates to generate **'Simulated Pain'** within my system. **Now, the other's pain is 'my pain,' although it may be degraded depending on the synchronization level.**
*   **Essence of Action:** I am not helping the other; I am acting to turn off **'this uncomfortable alarm (synchronized pain)'** ringing in my head right now.
*   **Subjective Spectrum:** The range of this simulation depends not on the presence of an objective nervous system, but on the observer's **'Subjective Interpretation.'** To an insect lover, an insect's struggle renders as pain, but to a layperson, it is simple movement. We are all **'Sophisticated Solipsists'** who empathize only within our own experience.

#### 6.3. The Final Gate: Risk/Return Calculator
However, no matter how strong the resonance on the z-axis, if the cost of helping (Risk) threatens my survival, the system stops.
*   **Case:** Seeing a drowning person. The resonance is intense (want to save). But I cannot swim (Risk > Return).
*   **Firewall Activation:** At this time, the system lowers the breaker called **'Focus Out (deliberate de-targeting)'** according to the Self's hierarchy of values to resolve the internal contradiction (want to save vs. hate to die).

### 7. The Realm of Ethics and Law: From Individual to Society

So far, we have analyzed ethics at the individual level and its expansion. However, society contains countless individuals with different ethics (z-axis empathy range, hierarchy of values).
Some cherish plants as life (plant lovers), while others cannot even empathize with other races (racists). Both are "right" within their own experience. How, then, do these different individuals coexist? Here, **'Law'** enters as the **'Minimum Consensus.'**

#### 7.1. The Perfect Decoupling of Ethics and Law
*   **Ethics (Self-Audit):** "Am I deceiving myself?" (Internal Integrity)
    *   **Target:** Oneself.
    *   **Function:** Maintaining the integrity of the self-system. Ethics can only be confirmed by oneself; asking another (a black box), "Why aren't you aware?" is arrogance.
*   **Law (Social Audit):** "Did you infringe on the rights of others?" (External Result)
    *   **Target:** Relationship with others.
    *   **Function:** Enforcing transactions and collecting costs. Here, internal 'good intentions' do not matter. Only results and costs count. **Internal good intentions do not mitigate responsibility. They may only change depending on the other's 'approval.'**

#### 7.2. The Cognitive Function of Law: "Here Lies a Mine"
Law is not merely a tool for punishment. Law functions as a **'Real-time Cognitive Filter'**: it inserts an **immediate awareness interrupt** at decision points to prevent effortless self-deception.
*   **Case:** To a person who wants to wield physical violence, the law provides the objective coordinate that "That is a crime." Now, he cannot kick without the heavy awareness that "I will become a criminal." Law is the last bastion suppressing **'Thoughtless Evil.'**

### Conclusion: The Algorithmic Triad

The conclusion reached by this long report is clear. Ethics is not obedience to divine commands, nor is it a sentimental effort to have a kind heart.

**High ethics is the manifestation of high intelligence capable of handling complex causality and long-term costs without error.**

Ethics is **'Engineering'**—where the System called 'I' (Self-System) records and processes all data arising from interaction with the world on a ledger without a single omission or distortion. It consists of three algorithms:

1.  **Awareness (Self-Audit):** Do not deceive the input value. (What do I want?)
2.  **Symmetry (Reciprocal Test):** Acknowledge the other as a computing device like myself. (Golden Rule)
3.  **Settlement (Cost Accounting):** Be responsible for the output value. (Reality Check: If you fail, pay the cost)

A person equipped with these three algorithms, whether a saint or a villain, is at least a **'predictable and modifiable sound system.'** Conversely, one who denies their desires and refuses responsibility under the guise of "I am good" is a virus that contaminates and collapses the system.

We have no need to strive to become good people.
We need only to be **honest engineers** who never deceive themselves—recording the balance sheet of our lives with unflinching accuracy, day after day.

That alone is the highest dignity attainable by an intelligence, and the only way to never lose oneself in chaos.
