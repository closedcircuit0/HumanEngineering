> The Hidden Code: How a Strict Hierarchy of Values Shapes All Human Behavior

### Preface: Why We Are Drawing This Map

Is there a single, universal grammar that runs through all the seemingly chaotic events of the human world — history, politics, economics, and your own life? This report answers, ‘Yes.’ The name of this grammar is The Principle of Human Action.

This report does not appeal to human ‘goodwill’ or preach ‘moral growth.’ Instead, it dissects, in the most dispassionate and practical way, the immutable ‘operating system (OS)’ by which the information processing system we call a human being functions.

By understanding this principle, we do not gain a crystal ball to prophesize an individual’s next move. Rather, we acquire a higher-level ‘lens’ — one that allows us to understand why human action seems fundamentally unpredictable, while simultaneously seeing through to the invariant laws operating beneath all that uncertainty.

This is the most powerful map for understanding yourself, others, and the world. It is a record of the ‘art of decryption’ for reading the terrain of all narrative wars.

### Part I: The Invariant Axioms — The Hierarchy of Values and The Engine of Action

All complex systems arise from simple rules. The human system is governed by a strict hierarchy of values and a single, universal computational process to serve it. Understanding this architecture is the first step.

#### Chapter 1: The First Principle — The Hierarchy of Values

All human action is determined by an invisible 'pecking order' of values. A system's behavior can only be understood by identifying which order of value is currently dominating the situation.

**Zeroth Order: The True Highest Value**

The only value for which a system is willing to sacrifice its own 'Survival.' This is so **extremely rare** that most people go their entire lives without ever having the opportunity to confront what their Zeroth Order value is. Therefore, in general analysis of human behavior, it is an 'exception' that can be statistically disregarded.

**First Order: Survival**

In all situations where the Zeroth Order value is not triggered, this absolute value acts as the **de facto King**. All other values can only exist on the precondition of 'Survival.' When the system faces a direct physical threat, all lower-order values are immediately nullified.

**Second Order: Core Values**

The **ruler in peacetime**, when 'Survival' is not under direct threat. Most human behaviors and conflicts are the result of competition and trade-offs between these Second Order values.

*   **'Survival Optimization':** The rational goal of creating a comfortable and flexible living environment.
*   **'The Extended Self (Family, etc.)':** The core relational network that is nearly identified with the self.
*   **'Narrative Coherence':** The desire to protect one's own story of "I am the kind of person who...".

**Third Order: Strategic Values**

The outermost values. Most of the values we express externally, such as 'Justice,' 'Ethics,' and 'Fairness,' belong here. These are not ends in themselves, but function as a kind of **Persona, and are values that can be strategically abandoned at times to protect or strengthen the higher-order values.**

#### Chapter 2: The Second Principle — Probabilistic Bias as The Engine of Calculation

Once the system has set its goal (overwhelmingly, the Core Values of the Second Order), a specific computational process is required to select a path.

> The system calculates the ‘expected loss (Risk)’ and ‘expected gain (Return)’ for all potential courses of action, based on past data, to achieve its goal.

This is the law that determines the **‘mechanism’** of human action. The engine for this calculation is **Probabilistic Bias**.

- **The Nature of Bias:** A bias is not an error. It is an **energy-efficient cognitive shortcut** built from past experiences. It is a predictive model that states, "In the past, X has most often led to Y."
- **Survival Optimization in Action:** Most social prejudices are the direct result of this engine operating to serve Survival Optimization. To navigate a complex social world, the system creates 'crude approximations' about groups and situations to minimize risk and reduce energy consumption.
- **The Illusion of Rationality and The Broadcast of Emotion:** This calculation process is the same whether it occurs consciously (deliberation) or unconsciously (habit, bias). And the final output of this calculation—the prediction of whether ‘my self-narrative will be reinforced or threatened’—is experienced by us as a powerful and immediate feedback signal: **‘Emotion.’** Feelings like **‘anticipation’ and ‘anxiety,’ ‘hope’ and ‘fear,’** are the real-time broadcasts of this computational process in action.

### Part II: The System’s Operating Environment — Irreversible Choices and The Rules

The two axioms do not operate in a vacuum. They reveal their essence in interaction with other systems and, above all, in the critical moment of an ‘irreversible choice.’

#### Chapter 3: The Crucible of Irreversible Choice — The Moment of Revelation

> A system’s true hierarchy of values is most transparently proven through its ‘final action’ at the crossroads of an irreversible choice.

- **Choice as a Crucible:** Situations that are difficult to undo once decided — such as marriage, a career change, a major investment, or, in the extreme, a choice in war — act as a ‘crucible’ that reveals an individual’s true priorities more accurately than any psychological test.
- **The Melting of Masks:** This extreme computational environment melts away all the social personas (the Strategic Values of the Third Order) and self-deceptions of everyday life. The dramatic emotions felt at this time, such as ‘pride’ or ‘shame,’ are the final report card, indicating whether one's core values (First Order, Second Order, or a leap to the Zeroth Order) were successfully defended or devastatingly betrayed in this crucible.

By observing this irreversible choice, we can predict the future behavioral patterns of an individual or a group with high probability. This is because the revealed core value hierarchy will very likely serve as a consistent benchmark in other significant choices they will face in the future.

#### Chapter 4: Attitude Towards ‘The Rules’ — The Art of Reading Hidden Intentions

> A system’s attitude toward the current ‘Rules’ and the form of the ‘future Rules’ it seeks to create most clearly reflect its true hierarchy of values.

This is the highest level of human action analysis. Look beyond their ‘play’; see what ‘game’ they want to play.

- **The Weak, Wielding Rules as a Weapon:** The weak, who judge the current ‘loose Rules’ as unfavorable to them, will advocate for ‘sophisticated Rules’ under the banner of ‘fairness’ to neutralize the arbitrary power of the strong. This is their most rational strategy for 'Survival Optimization' (Second Order).
- **The Strong, Using Rules as a Shield:** The strong, who benefit from the current ‘loose Rules,’ will try to prevent the emergence of ‘sophisticated Rules’ by promoting other narratives like ‘trust’ or ‘efficiency’ (Third Order) to maintain the status quo. This is their most rational strategy for 'Survival Optimization' (Second Order).

### Part III: The System’s Limits and Practical Wisdom

Now that we understand the system’s operating principles and its environment, we must finally explore the inherent limits of this system and the only ‘freedom’ and ‘wisdom’ we can possess in a state of acknowledging those limits.

#### Chapter 5: The Epistemological Limit — The Structure of ‘The Unknowable’

> An action is an equation with two unknown variables.

We cannot open up another’s mind. We must reverse-engineer the internal state that caused the action, using only the observable result: ‘behavior.’

- **The First Unknown (The Ambiguous Goal):** A system often does not clearly know its own true hierarchy of values (which values belong to the Second Order, or if it is deceiving itself by presenting a Third Order value as a Second Order one).
- **The Second Unknown (The Flawed Calculation):** Even if the goal is clear, the ‘risk-return assessment’ can be severely distorted by numerous variables (knowledge, fatigue, emotional state).

Therefore, prediction based on this principle is not prophecy, but **probabilistic inference.** It is impossible to perfectly distinguish from the outside whether a single ‘action’ resulted from an ‘ambiguous goal’ or a ‘flawed calculation.’

#### Chapter 6: Redefining ‘Freedom’ and ‘Wisdom’

In this world of determinism and uncertainty, what is the only ‘freedom’ and ‘wisdom’ we can possess? It is not a matter of ‘choice,’ but of ‘Awareness.’

> True freedom begins with ‘metacognitively recognizing’ the fact that ‘my actions are determined by my past and my values’.

- **Accepting Determinism:** We must acknowledge that our choices are deeply bound by our ‘interpolated past,’ which is the sum total of all our life experiences.
- **The Role of Metacognition:** ‘Freedom’ is not escaping this bondage. It is the ability to ask oneself, “Based on which of my ‘biases’ and ‘past experiences’ am I performing this calculation right now?” This metacognition creates a tiny ‘gap’ through which we can finely ‘adjust’ our calculation methods.

> True wisdom is the attitude of trying to make the best choice in a state of acknowledging the ‘possibility of self-deception’ (the first unknown) and the ‘possibility of calculation error’ (the second unknown) in both ‘oneself’ and ‘others’.

- **Wisdom about Oneself:** “I know that I know nothing.” Acknowledging that one’s true hierarchy of values might be unclear and one’s calculation might be wrong. Constantly doubting the possibility of one’s own self-deception and striving to learn from ‘mistakes.’
- **Wisdom about Others:** Not judging irrational behavior as ‘malice’ or ‘stupidity.’ Instead, trying to understand that, “Within his closed logical world, that must have been the best calculation.”

### Conclusion: The Map, and The Path Beyond

The Principle of Human Action takes away the romantic illusion of ‘free will,’ but in its place, it hands us a far more powerful and practical tool: the ability to read the ‘invisible code’ that moves ourselves and the world.

We may not be able to perfectly control our actions. We may not be able to easily change our ‘Hierarchy of Values.’ But we now have a ‘map’ to understand ‘why’ we act the way we do.

This ‘understanding’ is the beginning of all change. Holding this map, where will you take your next step? To take that step **‘with awareness’** — that is the only, and the greatest, **‘freedom’** that this report suggests a human can possess.
