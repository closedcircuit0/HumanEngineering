# The Engineering of Language

> A Relational Model of Emergent Meaning

### Preface: Meaning, Language, and the Ghost in Communication

This report presents a new perspective on the most fundamental question in the philosophy of language: “Where does the ‘meaning’ of a word reside?”

Our central argument is that ‘meaning’ is not a fixed essence inherent in words, but a phenomenon that dynamically emerges within the network of relationships between discontinuous linguistic signs and the context in which they are used.

We will argue that what we call ‘meaning’ is not an entity, but a functional effect that arises during the ‘Synchronization’ process, which the human intelligence performs to achieve specific goals in linguistic interactions. This report will present the logical basis for this argument, urging a fundamental reassessment of existing models of semantics and communication.

### Chapter 1: The First Principle — The Sign as an Empty Vessel and the Concept as an Image

All language begins from the same fundamental principle as the birth of numbers, discussed in ‘The Engineering of Mathematics’: the act of an intelligence imposing order on a discontinuous reality.

**1.1. The Arbitrariness and Discontinuity of Signs**

All linguistic signs (words, numbers, code) are inherently arbitrary. There is no necessary reason why the combination of sounds for ‘tree’ or the visual form for ‘1’ must be linked to the actual object or concept in reality. Language is not a continuous mirror reflecting reality, but a set of discontinuous signs created by humans to capture specific aspects of it.

**1.2. The Birth of the First Sign: Distinguishing and Grouping**

The first ‘word’ or the first number ‘1’ is a label that signifies the completion of a cognitive act: an intelligence distinguishing a meaningful pattern from chaos and grouping other instances of that pattern into a single category.

**1.3. The ‘Empty Vessel’ and the ‘Image’: The Relationship Between Sign and Concept**

Every sign is an ‘Empty Vessel,’ filled only by its connections to other signs. The feeling that a sign has its own inherent meaning is a cognitive illusion, born from the fact that the connection between a sign and a concept has been so strongly and repeatedly learned that the relationship feels like a property of the sign itself.

What, then, is the ‘Concept’ that fills this ‘Empty Vessel’? A ‘Concept’ is an internal ‘Image’ created by the sum total of multisensory experiential data that an individual has accumulated and linked to a specific sign.

The conceptual image of an “apple” is not just the visual information of being round and red, but a data cluster imprinted on the body, encompassing the crisp sound (auditory), the smooth feel in one’s hand (tactile), the sweet scent (olfactory), and the taste (gustatory).

### Chapter 2: The Mechanism of Emergent Meaning — The Dynamics of Network and Context

‘Meaning’ does not exist, but the ‘act of meaning’ certainly occurs. This can be explained through the following mechanism.

**2.1. Stage 1: The Network — The Structure of Potential Meaning**

The language model of an intelligence is like a vast relational network. Each sign (a node) is connected to other signs, and the strength of these connections is determined by their co-occurrence frequency and contextual similarity. The “tree” node is strongly linked not only to other sign nodes like “forest,” “leaf,” and “growth,” but also to the multisensory ‘image’ data of a tree as previously defined. This entire network constitutes the structure of a language’s ‘potential meaning.’

**2.2. Stage 2: The Context — The Activation and Selection of Meaning**

When a sign is used in an actual utterance, the surrounding signs (the context) ‘activate’ specific parts of this vast network. The ‘meaning’ is precisely this ‘pattern of activated pathways’ and the internal ‘image’ that arises from it.

**2.3. Stage 3: Emergence — The Completion of the Pattern**

When the activated pattern forms a single, coherent picture — that is, when cognitive contradiction is minimized — the experience of “meaning has been understood” emerges. This is not a process of finding a fixed meaning, but of completing the most probabilistically plausible network pattern under the given context.

### Chapter 3: Redefining Communication as ‘Re-translation’ and ‘Synchronization’

According to this model, communication is not the ‘transmission of meaning’ between a speaker and a listener.

**3.1. Encoding and Decoding: The Process of Re-translation**

- **Encoding:** The speaker activates a pattern in their internal network that best represents their internal world (intention, image), and arranges the ‘Empty Vessels’ (signs) that represent that pattern in a sequence to be sent out.
- **Decoding:** The listener receives the sequence of ‘Empty Vessels’ and activates their own internal network. This process is structurally identical to the mechanism of recalling a ‘memory.’ Based on their own experiences and images, they ‘reconstruct’ and ‘re-translate’ the pattern they presume the speaker sent. We do not accept another’s words as they are; we understand them by finding the closest equivalent within our own internal world.

**3.2. Synchronization: The Definition of Successful Communication**

‘Successful communication’ does not mean that the speaker’s image and the listener’s image have become 100% identical. It means that, for the purpose of achieving a specific goal (information transfer, emotional sharing, joint action, etc.), their two internal worlds have become ‘synchronized’ into a sufficiently similar state.

An intelligence ‘integrates’ the information received through ‘re-translation’ into its own existing world. Even if the speaker sent the ‘Empty Vessel’ of “tree” filled with the image of a ‘lush, leafy deciduous tree in summer,’ if the listener’s core image of “tree” is a ‘bare, coniferous tree in winter,’ it is the latter image that will be activated in their mind. This is the reality of ‘re-translation.’

However, if the purpose of the communication is to “meet under the tree,” this difference in imagery poses no problem. This is what it means for their internal worlds to be sufficiently ‘synchronized’ to achieve a specific goal.

Consequently, all communication is inherently an approximation, and misunderstanding is not a failure of the process but its essential property.

### Chapter 4: The Hierarchy of Language — The Spectrum of ‘Image Variance’

Different languages can be positioned on a single continuous spectrum. This spectrum is defined by the ‘Degree of Image Variance’ that each language allows — that is, its tolerance for approximation. At one end of the spectrum lies ‘maximum flexibility,’ and at the other, ‘ultimate precision.’

**4.1. Natural Language: The Archetype of the Network**

- **Degree of Image Variance:** Extremely high.
- **Characteristics:** Natural language is the archetype of all language systems. The images associated with a sign like “tree” are immensely varied across individuals and cultures. This ambiguity and richness are not bugs, but core features optimized for ‘synchronizing’ complex and subtle internal worlds — emotions, intentions, narratives — with others.
- **Relationship with The Body:** Gesture is part of natural language. By embodying abstract thoughts in concrete physical actions, it reduces the cognitive energy expenditure of the brain and helps to ‘bind’ linguistic information with physical information, aiding in the encoding and retrieval of memory. ‘Thinking’ is a distributed process that mobilizes the entire hardware of the body, not just the brain.

**4.2. Mathematics: The Formal Language for Prediction**

- **Degree of Image Variance:** Extremely low.
- **Characteristics:** Mathematics is a formal language constructed by extracting only concepts related to ‘pattern,’ ‘structure,’ and ‘quantity’ from the network of natural language, and then intentionally eliminating all ambiguity and context-dependency to rebuild them with strict axioms and rules. The ‘image’ you and I evoke for the sign “1” converges almost perfectly to the abstract concept of ‘singularity.’
- **Purpose:** The sole purpose of mathematics is ‘Prediction.’ It is a language that has gained predictive certainty by sacrificing the flexibility of natural language.

**4.3. Programming Languages: The Protocol for Human-Machine Synchronization**

- **Degree of Image Variance:** Nearly non-existent.
- **Characteristics:** A programming language is an ‘intermediate language’ designed to translate the logical intentions of a human into precise commands that a machine can understand. The ‘image’ for a command like x = 1 converges to the single, concrete ‘operational image’ of “assign the integer value 1 to the memory location x.”
- **Purpose:** The purpose is a near-perfect ‘synchronization’ between human intelligence and machine intelligence (the CPU). A bug signifies a failure in this synchronization.

**4.4. Machine Language: The Ultimate Precision**

- **Degree of Image Variance:** Zero.
- **Characteristics:** Machine language is composed of only two signs, 0 and 1, and the extremely limited operations the CPU can physically perform. A sequence of signs like 101100 allows for no variance in ‘image’; it is directly linked to a single physical action.
- **Purpose:** Not ‘interpretation,’ but ‘Execution’ itself. It is a state where language and action have become perfectly identical, like directly raising another’s arm with language. This bypasses the inefficient processes required in natural language, such as ‘persuasion’ or ‘coercion,’ to achieve a desired action.

**4.5. Expanding the Spectrum: Non-verbal Language Systems**

This spectrum of ‘image variance’ is not limited to languages based on text or sound. Other forms of sign systems also find their place on this spectrum, following the same principle of ‘synchronization.’

- **Music:** Extremely high image variance. Music is a language specialized in synchronizing emotional ‘Flow.’
- **Visual Language (e.g., Painting, Photography):** Variable image variance. Representational art has low variance, while abstract art intentionally maximizes it.
- **Sign Language:** High image variance (similar to natural language). A complete language using space and movement as signs.

### Chapter 5: Metaphor, Bias, and the Expansion of the Network

How does the linguistic network expand? How are abstract concepts formed? The key lies in ‘Metaphor,’ which is deeply intertwined with the principles of ‘Bias’ and the ‘pursuit of energy efficiency’ as discussed in ‘The Engineering of the Self.’

The **Mechanism of Metaphor:** We do not ‘invent’ entirely new abstract concepts. We build new understanding by ‘copying’ the network structure of a concrete experiential domain we already know well (war, money, a journey) and ‘pasting’ it onto an abstract conceptual domain.

An **Energy-Efficient Strategy:** The metaphor “Argument is War” is a strategy that avoids building a new neural network by ‘recycling’ a pre-existing ‘bias’ — the well-paved ‘neural highway’ associated with ‘war.’

**Metaphor as Bias:** Metaphor is a highly rational ‘cognitive shortcut’ that the brain uses to reduce uncertainty and integrate new information into its existing, comfortable worldview.

### Chapter 6: Philosophical Implications

This theory carries significant philosophical implications.

- **The Relativity of Truth:** ‘Linguistic truth’ is not reality itself, but the narrative that has been most powerfully synchronized within the network and context of a specific era and community.
- **Humility in Communication:** We must recognize that all conversation is a ‘synchronization attempt’ that fundamentally contains the possibility of misunderstanding, and a process of ‘re-translating’ another’s words within our own internal world.
- **The ‘I’ as a Narrative:** The ‘Self’ or ‘identity’ is also constructed through the linguistic narrative of “I am a person who…”.

### Conclusion: The End of Objective Meaning

‘Meaning’ is like a ghost to be hunted. The more you try to grasp it, the further it flees. We cannot possess meaning. We can only, on the sea of discontinuous signs, continuously ‘create’ the waves of meaning with others.

The essence of language lies not in ‘Being,’ but in ‘Relating’ and ‘Becoming.’
