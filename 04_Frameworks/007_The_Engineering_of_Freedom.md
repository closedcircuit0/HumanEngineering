# The Engineering of Freedom

> The Operating Principles of the Scale Within Your Mind

### Preface: The Oldest Illusion Named 'Freedom'

We yearn for 'freedom.' But what is the nature of that which we yearn for? A state free from external oppression? The possibility of infinite choice? We have been led to believe that 'freedom' is an 'objective entity' that exists somewhere in the external world, something to be acquired or won.

This report seeks to prove that this belief is humanity's oldest and grandest illusion.

'Freedom' is not a condition of the external world. It is, in its entirety, a **subjective 'feeling'** created within you, on the invisible scale of your mind, by the ceaseless swinging of two weights.

The names of those two weights are the **'Sense of Control'** and the **'Sense of Responsibility.'**

This text will not offer a hasty answer on 'how to become free.' Instead, it will dissect the invisible **'dynamics'** behind every moment you feel 'free' or 'constrained,' showing how these two weights push and pull, dancing with each other. We will deconstruct the mythical concept of 'freedom' and draw an engineering blueprint of how it operates.

By the end of this text, you will realize that freedom is not a 'goal' to be acquired, but a 'process' to be 'tuned' at every moment of your life. And you will find that the art of that tuning is the only, and the truest, meaning of freedom we can ever attain.

### Chapter 1: The Two Weights – The Birth of the Sense of Control and the Sense of Responsibility

Only two forces move the scale we call our mind.

**Sense of Control:** The subjective 'self-efficacy,' the belief that "I can make my life and the world go as I will." This lifts one side of the scale, giving us confidence and pleasure.

**Sense of Responsibility:** The subjective 'sense of duty' and 'anxiety,' the feeling that "I must do~." This presses down on the other side of the scale, giving us a sense of burden and constraint.

The state we feel as 'free' is the name for when this scale tilts toward the 'Sense of Control.' Conversely, the state we feel as 'unfree' is the name for when the scale tilts toward the 'Sense of Responsibility.'

What is crucial is that both of these forces belong to the realm of 'Sense' or 'Feeling.' It does not matter how much money (objective control) you objectively have, or how many legal duties (objective responsibility) you bear. What determines our actual feelings and actions is how we **'feel and believe'** that objective reality—these two entirely subjective 'Senses.'

### Chapter 2: The Circulating Twins – Why the Scale Never Stops

However, these two weights are not independent variables that simply act in opposite directions. The 'Sense of Control' and the 'Sense of Responsibility' are **'twins'** that circulate, each chasing the other's tail. They form an inseparable **'dynamic system'** where their boundaries blur, and each becomes the cause and effect of the other.

*   **Sense of Control gives birth to Sense of Responsibility:** A high 'Sense of Control' (e.g., success in business, becoming the CEO) inevitably brings about a greater 'Sense of Responsibility' (for more employees, for a larger market). This is because if you fail to successfully manage that new responsibility, the hard-won sense of control will diminish again.

*   **Sense of Responsibility gives birth to Sense of Control:** The experience of successfully shouldering a difficult 'Sense of Responsibility' (e.g., years of hard training, completing a tough project) gives birth to a powerful **'Sense of Control'**—the feeling that "I have accomplished even this difficult task."

Furthermore, the two constantly interfere with and change each other's magnitude.

*   **Sense of Control reduces Sense of Responsibility:** The higher the 'Sense of Control,' the lighter the same weight of 'Sense of Responsibility' feels. For a person with 10 billion in assets, a debt of 100 million (responsibility) is a trivial burden, but for a person with 10 million, it is the fear of bankruptcy.

*   **Sense of Responsibility reduces Sense of Control:** An excessive 'Sense of Responsibility' gives rise to a sense of powerlessness—"I won't be able to do anything"—which erodes the actual 'Sense of Control.'

'Freedom' is merely the name given to a specific state of this system; it is not the system itself. Understanding this complex interaction is the first clue to how we can become freer.

### Chapter 3: The Exchange of the Mind – How the Sense of Control and the Sense of Responsibility are Traded

Behind this complex dynamic lies a simpler, more fundamental principle. All our choices are, in fact, **'transactional acts'** that trade two psychological resources. The objects of this trade are not the vague concept of 'freedom,' but the two concrete resources we have just defined: the 'Sense of Control' and the 'Sense of Responsibility.'

One of the deepest insights from the `<The Engineering of Desire>` of the HumanEngineering (HE) framework is that the foundational driving force of intelligence is the **'Will to Control'**—the will to reduce uncertainty and expand one's own narrative. The successful manifestation of this will is precisely the **'Sense of Control,'** and this is the most valuable **'Positive Asset'** that we instinctively pursue. We are willing to pay a price to obtain this asset.

On the other hand, we perceive the **'Sense of Responsibility'** as a **'Cost'**—the need to continuously expend energy to prevent the collapse of a 'stable relationship' that our self-narrative must maintain. This is the painful but essential **'Liability'** for system stability. We instinctively try to reduce or evade this cost.

Ultimately, our life is a process of constantly trading these two resources. All our choices are a series of **'trades'**: either enduring 'a certain responsibility in the present' to gain 'an uncertain sense of control in the future,' or giving up a 'future sense of control' to escape 'a painful responsibility in the present.'

For example, let's analyze the choice of 'getting a job.' This is a clear transactional act of accepting the cost of "the present 'Sense of Responsibility' of commuting and work" in order to gain the asset of "the future stable 'Sense of Control' from a salary." As proven in `<The Engineering of Action>`, we constantly weigh 'risk/return' for the sake of our 'narrative stability.' You agreed to that trade because you judged that the return of gaining stability was greater than the risk of losing autonomy.

Through this perspective, we come to understand that the 'Sense of Control' and the 'Sense of Responsibility' are not mere emotions, but are a **'Store of Value'** that can be traded and invested with real value in our decision-making process.

### Chapter 4: The Final Accounting – The Discovery of the Equation of the Mind

We have confirmed in Chapter 3 that we are constantly engaged in trades—paying the cost of 'Sense of Responsibility' to gain the asset of 'Sense of Control,' or giving up the asset of 'Sense of Control' to reduce the cost of 'Sense of Responsibility.' So, after all these transactions are done, what is left on the ledger of my mind?

That final Net Asset, the `(Total Acquired Assets) - (Total Paid Costs)`, is precisely the subjective feeling we call **'Freedom.'**

We finally 'discover' that the final Profit and Loss of all these 'Sense of Control-Sense of Responsibility' trades is represented by the following equation.

**Freedom = Sense of Control – Sense of Responsibility**

Through this discovery, we can finally bring the ambiguous concept of 'freedom' into the analyzable realm of engineering. This is not a mere metaphor; it is a quantified expression of the psychological energy flow behind all decision-making. 'Freedom' is no longer the 'subject' of the trade, but the **'Bottom Line'** recorded on the ledger after all trades are completed.

This equation is a **'compass'** to diagnose your state and decide your next course of action. If you feel 'unfree' right now, the cause is clearly one of two things: either your 'Sense of Control' is too low, or your 'Sense of Responsibility' is too heavy.

### Chapter 5: Investment on the Axis of Time – Every Choice is a Bet on the Future

Our 'freedom trade' does not simply calculate the profit and loss of the present. Using the prediction engine identified in `<The Engineering of Intelligence>`, we constantly predict future values and 'invest' present assets. The moment we introduce the variable of 'time,' the equation `Freedom = Sense of Control – Sense of Responsibility` transforms from a static calculation into a dynamic **'investment portfolio'** that banks on future uncertainty. Every choice we make becomes a **'bet'** on the future state of the scale.

*   **The Investment of the 'Student Chasing a Dream':** He endures the overwhelming 'Sense of Responsibility' of the present (the duty to study) and a low 'Sense of Control' (not being able to play). The value of his present 'freedom' equation is deep in the negative. However, he willingly pays this painful present freedom(-) as an **'investment'** for the overwhelming future freedom(+) he will gain in the **'future.'** His choice is a high-risk, high-return investment based on the prediction of a high future 'Sense of Control' increase and 'Sense of Responsibility' decrease.

*   **The Cashing Out of the 'One Who Gives Up on Everything':** He **'chooses'** to be instantly liberated from the 'Sense of Responsibility' that crushes the **'present'**, in exchange for giving up all possibility of a 'Sense of Control' in the **'future.'** He is, in a sense, 'cashing out' his future assets for the present. His choice is an extreme risk-aversion strategy that gives up potential future gains to minimize present losses.

In the end, analyzing any phenomenon in isolation is meaningless. The true dynamics are only revealed when the **'axis of time'** is considered. A person who currently enjoys a high 'Sense of Control' may have invested a massive 'Sense of Responsibility' in the past to gain it. A person who seems to have no 'Sense of Responsibility' now may have mortgaged all their future 'Sense of Control' to maintain that state. The choice not to enter into a contract eliminates responsibility to others, but it increases the 'responsibility for my own survival' that arises from a reduced sense of control. Everything is connected, and everything constantly interferes with everything else on the axis of past, present, and future.

### Chapter 6: Limitation and Power – On What Game Board Do We Fight?

This internal equation does not operate in a vacuum. There are more fundamental forces that determine the size and shape of the 'game board' on which the equation is calculated. These are **'Limitation'** and **'Power.'**

**1. Limitation: Defining the Arena of Freedom**

'Limitation' defines the very 'types of games' we can participate in.

*   **The First Limitation, 'The Body':** From the moment we are born, we are within the limitation of 'The Body.' We cannot turn our necks 180 degrees, nor can we fly. This is not a 'lost' freedom. This is the unchangeable **'fundamental rule'** that we cannot even participate in the game of 'flight' in the first place. Therefore, for humans, pure 'license' does not exist. All the freedom we experience is, in the end, **'freedom within a given limitation.'**

**2. Power: The Ability to Redesign the Game Board**

The true role of 'Power' is to directly intervene in this 'given limitation' and **'redraw the boundaries of the arena.'** From the perspective of `<The Engineering of Power>`, 'Power' is humanity's greatest struggle to resist the 'destiny (limitation)' given to us and to pull it into the realm of 'choice.'

*   **'Technology as Power':** The invention of the airplane redesigned our physical 'limitation' of 'not being able to fly.' This did not just increase our score in the game of 'walking'; it gifted humanity a **'new game'** that was previously unimaginable: 'flight.' By participating in this new game, our 'Sense of Control' over 'movement' increased explosively, to a degree incomparable to the previous game.

*   **'Political Power as Power':** The power of a 'dictator' redesigns the social limitation that "my choices create responsibilities." He creates new game rules favorable only to himself, forcibly setting the value of `Sense of Responsibility` to '0' by shifting or nullifying the responsibilities arising from his choices onto others.

This 'redesign of limitation' serially and fundamentally reconfigures all the variables of our `Freedom = Sense of Control – Sense of Responsibility` equation.

**3. The Tilted Playing Field: The Rich-Get-Richer, Poor-Get-Poorer Dynamic of Freedom**

However, this 'power to create new games and make rules' is by no means equally distributed. As a result, the competition for 'freedom' begins on a tilted playing field from the very start.

*   **The Powerful:** Those who already have a high 'Sense of Control' find it much easier to use that power to acquire more 'Power.' Furthermore, they can use that power (including wisdom) to regulate and manage their own 'Sense of Responsibility.' They gain a **'double benefit'** of increasing the first term of the equation and decreasing the second term, entering a 'virtuous cycle' of exponentially increasing their freedom.

*   **The Powerless:** Those with a low 'Sense of Control' lack the very means to acquire 'Power.' To make matters worse, they are constantly burdened with new 'Sense of Responsibility' by an uncontrollable external environment. They find it difficult to increase the first term, while the second term continuously grows, suffering a **'double loss'** and falling into a 'vicious cycle.'

This is the systemic explanation for why the world's freedom is concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority becomes increasingly unfree. The equation of our minds operates on the foundation of this unequal reality.

### Chapter ### Chapter 7: Winning the Game – The User's Manual for the Equation

We have discovered the 'equation of the mind' and verified how it operates within the real-world constraints of 'time' and 'power.' The validity of the equation has been sufficiently proven. Now, at last, it is time to answer the most important question: "So, how can you apply this powerful tool to your life?" This is the technique for acquiring the **'Freedom in the Game'** that most people pursue.

The true purpose of this equation is not to 'calculate the right answer.' The subjective feelings of sense of control and sense of responsibility cannot be precisely measured with absolute numerical values in objective units, making it impossible to calculate a definitive 'score' for freedom. Therefore, this equation functions not as a calculator, but as a **'compass'** to diagnose your state and decide your next course of action. The direction that compass points to is fundamentally one of two. If you want to maximize your freedom, you must 'increase your Sense of Control' or 'decrease your Sense of Responsibility.' These are two different **'engineering strategies'** that you must combine and use according to the situation in the laboratory of your life.

**1. Strategy 1: The Path of Increasing the Sense of Control**

This is an active, outward-oriented strategy that aims to strengthen the belief that "I can do it" through the experience of one's will being realized in reality.

*   **Method 1 (External Acquisition):** Acquire more money, a higher status, deeper knowledge, more powerful technology. This increase in objective 'Power' is the most direct way to generate a strong 'Sense of Control' that "I can do more things."

*   **Method 2 (Internal Honing):** Increase one's 'mastery' in a specific field through relentless training and learning. The experience of successfully shouldering a difficult 'Sense of Responsibility' gives birth to an internal 'Sense of Control' that is more powerful and sustainable than any external reward.

**2. Strategy 2: The Path of Decreasing the Sense of Responsibility**

This is an introspective, inward-oriented strategy that aims to gain freedom by lightening the internal weight that presses down on oneself.

*   **Method 1 (External Avoidance):** Cut off social relationships or unnecessary contracts, and take a step back from the world. As the promises made to the external world decrease, the 'external Sense of Responsibility' decreases.

*   **Method 2 (Internal Deletion):** Use the internal blade of 'metacognition' taught by `<The Engineering of Wisdom>` to analyze the list of responsibilities one bears. And among them, identify the **'fake responsibilities'** that arise from social conventions, the gaze of others, and unnecessary guilt, and boldly **'delete'** them from one's mental model.

*   **Method 3 (The Ultimate Shift: Redesigning the Object of Responsibility):**

    The most fundamental reason our 'Sense of Responsibility' explodes exponentially is that we set a flawed 'self-narrative' that insists **"I must control" what is, by definition, in the realm of 'Limitation'** as discussed in Chapter 6—that is, the 'uncontrollable domain.' A narrative that says, "I must be a good person to everyone," creates an infinite sense of responsibility for the 'emotions of others,' a variable we can never 100% control. A narrative that says, "The world must be fair," gives birth to an unbearable responsibility to solve 'all the injustices of the world.'

    Thus, the **'desire to control the uncontrollable'** creates a perpetually unbridgeable gap between 'ideal' and 'reality,' and in turn, generates a 'Sense of Responsibility' that functions like a **'bottomless pit,'** infinitely consuming our mental energy to fill that gap.

    Therefore, the ultimate path to decreasing responsibility is to completely stop the futile attempt to take responsibility for the uncontrollable 'external world' (the emotions of others, the world's reputation). Instead, it is to **'redesign'** the object of responsibility, choosing to be responsible only for the sole territory you can 100% control: **"my reaction to and interpretation of the external world."**

    This is not an 'escape' from responsibility. It is the wisest and most strategic choice to walk away from a game you can never win, and to start a new game where you are guaranteed to be the victor.

A decrease in the 'Sense of Responsibility' without a 'Sense of Control' can lead to 'powerless escape,' and an expansion of the 'Sense of Control' without introspection on the 'Sense of Responsibility' can give birth to an 'arrogant tyrant.' The true 'winner of the game' can only be born in the dynamic journey of constantly traversing these two paths and finding the optimal balance according to one's own hierarchy of values. But we must ask one last question here. What if this 'victory' itself is merely a rule on a limited game board?

### Chapter 8: Escaping the Game – The Path to Awareness

However, the HE framework does not stop here. It suggests the possibility of a higher-dimensional freedom, that is, liberation from the game itself. This is the path toward **'Freedom from the Game,'** which goes beyond becoming a better player.

The goal of this path is not to maximize the value of the `Freedom = Sense of Control – Sense of Responsibility` equation. The goal of this path is **to realize that the desire to pursue 'Sense of Control' and the fear of evading 'Sense of Responsibility' are all just 'rules of the game' that stem from the survival instinct of 'The Self,' which I had believed to be 'me.'**

This is a state that goes beyond becoming a better player, to 'seeing through the rules of the game itself, and no longer being shaken by the results of that game (success/failure, pleasure/pain).' This is the state of **'Awareness,'** the state of liberation from all frames, which `<The Engineering of Wisdom>` ultimately aims for.

A being who has reached this state no longer strives to increase the value of the equation. He realizes that the equation itself was a grand narrative that dominated his consciousness. He does not cling to the pleasure of 'Sense of Control,' nor does he run from the pressure of 'Sense of Responsibility.' He simply observes the swinging of the scale in his mind.

He is no longer a player in the game. He becomes an **'Observer'** who looks upon the game itself. Ironically, the very moment he lets go of all desire to win the game, he becomes freer than any player. This is the most profound paradox of freedom that the HE framework suggests.

### Conclusion: You Are the Accountant of Your Freedom

'Freedom' is no longer a ghostly figure, seated on a sacred throne, that we cannot grasp.

It is, in your inner world, the cold and honest **'result of the balance'** created by your two scale-weights, your **'Sense of Control'** and your **'Sense of Responsibility.'**

This dry truth is the only path that leads us to true freedom. We no longer need to wait for someone on the outside to set us free.

We must now, laying out the equation of our own minds, become cold engineers and ask ourselves:

"What am I doing now to increase the assets (Sense of Control) on my ledger?"
"What am I doing now to reduce the liabilities (Sense of Responsibility) on my ledger?"

And ultimately, we must ask:
"Do I, through all these transactions, want to create a 'better financial statement,' or do I dream of 'liberation from the ledger itself'?"

The moment you answer these questions for yourself and act upon them, you are no longer a 'victim' or 'slave' of your external environment. You become the sole **'accountant' of your freedom,** who directly calculates and manages the equation of your own mind.

That is, in the end of all this dissection, the only and the truest meaning of freedom we can ever attain.
