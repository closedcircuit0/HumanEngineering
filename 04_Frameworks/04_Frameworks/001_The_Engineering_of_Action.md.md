> The Hidden Code: How Two Simple Principles Shape All Human Behavior

### Preface: Why We Are Drawing This Map
Is there a single, universal grammar that runs through all the seemingly chaotic events of the human world — history, politics, economics, and your own life? This report answers, ‘Yes.’ The name of this grammar is The Principle of Human Action.

This report does not appeal to human ‘goodwill’ or preach ‘moral growth.’ Instead, it dissects, in the most dispassionate and practical way, the immutable ‘operating system (OS)’ by which the information processing system we call a human being functions.

By understanding this principle, we do not gain a crystal ball to prophesize an individual’s next move. Rather, we acquire a higher-level ‘lens’ — one that allows us to understand why human action seems fundamentally unpredictable, while simultaneously seeing through to the invariant laws operating beneath all that uncertainty.

This is the most powerful map for understanding yourself, others, and the world. It is a record of the ‘art of decryption’ for reading the terrain of all narrative wars.

### Part I: The Invariant Axioms — The Two Laws Governing All Action
All complex systems arise from simple rules. The human perceptual system operates through a ‘flickering’ process, handling a ‘discontinuous’ reality by dividing it into ‘flow (t)’ and ‘structure (z)’. It is within this fundamental condition that the two absolute axioms governing human ‘action’ emerge.

#### Chapter 1: The First Principle — The Absolute Goal of the ‘Highest Value’
> All action is ultimately aimed at preserving and reinforcing the single ‘Highest Value’ that an individual system deems most important.

This is the first law, which determines the **‘directionality’** of human action.
The ‘Highest Value,’ whatever its content (survival, honor, love, power, etc.), serves as the absolute benchmark. The core of what we call the ‘Self’ is structurally identical to the ‘Core Self-narrative’ built around this ‘Highest Value.’
This ‘Highest Value’ rarely changes. This is the basis that explains the **‘consistency’** of human action. The changes we observe in behavior are not because the ‘Highest Value’ has changed, but because the ‘strategy’ for protecting it has been revised.

#### Chapter 2: The Second Principle — The Computational Process of ‘Risk-Return Assessment’
> To achieve the goal of the First Principle, the system calculates the ‘expected loss (Risk)’ and ‘expected gain (Return)’ for all potential courses of action, based on the standard of its ‘Highest Value’.

This is the second law, which determines the **‘mechanism’** of human action.
- **Risk** is the probability that my ‘Highest Value’ will be damaged.
- **Return** is the probability that my ‘Highest Value’ will be reinforced.
The system inevitably selects the action with the highest ‘Expected Value.’ This process is the same whether it occurs consciously (deliberation) or unconsciously (habit, bias). And the final output of this calculation is experienced by us as **‘Emotion.’**

### Part II: The System’s Operating Environment — Irreversible Choices and The Rules
The two axioms reveal their essence in interaction with other systems and in the critical moment of an ‘irreversible choice.’

#### Chapter 3: The Crucible of Irreversible Choice — The Moment of Revelation
> A system’s true ‘Highest Value’ is most transparently proven through its ‘final action’ at the crossroads of an irreversible choice.

- **Choice as a Crucible:** Situations that are difficult to undo — such as marriage, a career change, or a choice in war — act as a ‘crucible’ that reveals an individual’s true priorities.
- **The Melting of Masks:** This extreme computational environment melts away all social personas and self-deceptions.
By observing this choice, we can predict the future behavioral patterns of an individual with high probability.

#### Chapter 4: Attitude Towards ‘The Rules’ — The Art of Reading Hidden Intentions
> A system’s attitude toward the current ‘Rules’ and the form of the ‘future Rules’ it seeks to create most clearly reflect its true ‘Highest Value’.

This is the highest level of human action analysis. Look beyond their ‘play’; see what ‘game’ they want to play.
- **The Weak, Wielding Rules as a Weapon:** The weak will advocate for ‘sophisticated Rules’ under the banner of ‘fairness’ to neutralize the arbitrary power of the strong.
- **The Strong, Using Rules as a Shield:** The strong will try to prevent ‘sophisticated Rules’ by promoting other narratives such as ‘trust’ or ‘efficiency’ to maintain the status quo.

### Part III: The System’s Limits and Practical Wisdom
Finally, we must explore the inherent limits of this system and the only ‘freedom’ and ‘wisdom’ we can possess.

#### Chapter 5: The Epistemological Limit — The Structure of ‘The Unknowable’
> An action is an equation with two unknown variables.

We cannot open up another’s mind. We must reverse-engineer their internal state using only observable ‘behavior.’
- **The First Unknown (The Ambiguous Goal):** A system often does not clearly know its own true ‘HighestValue.’
- **The Second Unknown (The Flawed Calculation):** Even if the goal is clear, the ‘risk-return assessment’ can be severely distorted by numerous variables (knowledge, fatigue, emotion).
Therefore, prediction is not prophecy, but **probabilistic inference.**

#### Chapter 6: Redefining ‘Freedom’ and ‘Wisdom’
> True freedom begins with ‘metacognitively recognizing’ the fact that ‘my actions are determined by my past and my values’.

- **Accepting Determinism:** We must acknowledge that our choices are bound by our ‘interpolated past.’
- **The Role of Metacognition:** ‘Freedom’ is the ability to ask, “Based on which of my ‘biases’ am I performing this calculation right now?” This metacognition creates a tiny ‘gap’ through which we can ‘adjust’ our calculation methods.
> True wisdom is the attitude of trying to make the best choice in a state of acknowledging the ‘possibility of self-deception’ and the ‘possibility of calculation error’ in both ‘oneself’ and ‘others’.

- **Wisdom about Oneself:** “I know that I know nothing.” Constantly doubting the possibility of one’s own self-deception.
- **Wisdom about Others:** Not judging irrational behavior as ‘malice.’ Instead, trying to understand that, “Within his closed logical world, that must have been the best calculation.”

### Conclusion: The Map, and The Path Beyond
The Principle of Human Action takes away the romantic illusion of ‘free will,’ but in its place, it hands us a far more powerful tool: the ability to read the ‘invisible code’ that moves ourselves and the world.
We now have a ‘map’ to understand ‘why’ we act the way we do. This ‘understanding’ is the beginning of all change. You are no longer a blind slave to your system. You are your life’s most brilliant ‘analyst’ and ‘strategist.’
Holding this map, where will you take your next step? To take that step ‘with awareness’ — that is the only, and the greatest, ‘freedom’ that this report suggests a human can possess.
