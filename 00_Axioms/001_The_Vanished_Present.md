# The Vanished Present: You Exist Only Between Flow and Structure

> The physics and philosophy of a moment that never arrives — and why it defines everything.

## Preface: Where Do We Stand?

We believe we live in the present, here and now. This seems to be an unquestionable truth, the starting point and destination of all experience. But is the ground of this present truly solid? The ‘now’ in which you are reading this sentence, the very moment you try to grasp it, has already crumbled into an afterimage of the past.

Is the ‘present’ an infinitely thin blade between the past and the future, upon which we can never truly rest? Or is it the most fundamental illusion we have ever created, one that never existed in the first place?

This report deconstructs the greatest myth of all: the ‘present.’ And on its ruins, it will reveal the fundamental mechanism by which we create the world through a ‘Flickering’ — a ceaseless oscillation between two different realities, ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure.’ By the end of this journey, you will realize that we are not beings who belong to time, but the very process that creates it. And you will understand that the Vanished Present was the one and only condition under which our perception, emotions, Self, and the narrative we call life could have ever been born.

## Chapter 1: Imaginative Correction — The Single Engine at the Beginning of Everything

At the deepest core of all our perceptual activities lies a single, fundamental engine: ‘Imaginative Correction.’ The sole and absolute mission of this engine is to fill the ‘Gaps’ in the discontinuous and incomplete data we encounter, using the most plausible information to construct a complete reality.

This is not a philosophical speculation, but a physical reality of perception. It takes tens to hundreds of milliseconds (ms) for light to reach your retina and for that photochemical signal to travel through the optic nerve to be processed as an ‘image’ in the visual cortex of your brain. The moment you ‘see’ the monitor in front of you, you, the subject of that perception, are already living in a world that is hundreds of milliseconds in the ‘past.’ The only thing we ever hold in our hands is past data.

The ‘present’ never reaches our perceptual system. This is the physical proof of the Vanished Present.

How, then, can we catch a ball flying toward us in real-time or have a seamless conversation? It is because this ‘Imaginative Correction’ engine works furiously to fill the fundamental information vacuum left by the Vanished Present. The engine takes the delayed past data and preemptively calculates the ‘state that is about to happen,’ filling the gaps in reality. At this stage, time and space, interpolation and prediction, are still an undivided, integrated process.

## Chapter 2: The Origin of Differentiation — The Deep Dive into the tz-Theory

Our 3-dimensional cognitive system cannot process this integrated ‘Imaginative Correction’ process all at once. Due to this cognitive limitation, the system divides this single engine into two different ‘Operational Modes,’ depending on the type of ‘Gap’ that needs to be filled. This is the difference in ‘perspective,’ and it is the origin of the differentiation between t and z, the two realities we experience.

To clarify how our intelligence uses this single engine, let us explicitly define these two modes. This definition is a core promise that will run through the entire series.

#### t-Mode: Flow Construction

The core function of this mode is ‘Connecting.’ It focuses on creating a smooth ‘Flow’ or ‘Process’ by assigning causal and narrative links between scattered pieces of information. The primary tool used here is Interpolation, and it answers the questions, “How did it flow to get here?” or “How will it flow to reach the goal?” Its output takes the form of stories, plans, and historical narratives.

#### z-Mode: Structure Recognition

The core function of this mode is ‘Grasping.’ It focuses on identifying a static ‘Structure’ or ‘Model’ by extracting patterns and relationships from a set of information. The primary tools used here are Prediction and Abstraction, and it answers the questions, “What is its essence?” or “What is the whole picture?” Its output takes the form of analysis, judgment, and blueprints.

We must remember that ‘interpolation’ and ‘prediction’ are fundamentally one and the same. Both are ways in which the ‘Imaginative Correction’ engine fills the gaps of our incomplete reality. We simply call it ‘t-mode’ when we use the engine from the perspective of creating ‘Flow,’ and we call it ‘z-mode’ when we use it from the perspective of creating ‘Structure.’

## Chapter 3: Liberation from Time — The Two Modes Transcending Past and Future

The fact that t and z are ‘Modes of Focus’ rather than axes of time reveals how free our mental activities are from the linear constraints of past, present, and future. These two modes are universal information processing methods that can operate at any point in time.

#### Imaginative Correction Toward the Past:

*   **(The Flow of the Past, t-Mode):** A historian connects various historical events with ‘causal links (Flow)’ to create a grand historical narrative, such as, “The A event led to the B revolution.” You weave together the fragmented memories of last night to reconstruct a single, continuous story: “I made that mistake because I was drunk.”
*   **(The Structure of the Past, z-Mode):** An archaeologist finds a ‘hidden pattern (Structure)’ among scattered artifacts to infer their identity: “This is a ritual tool from Civilization A.” You look back on a past relationship and analyze, “Our relationship had this imbalanced structure from the very beginning.” The act of ‘looking at myself objectively’ is precisely the operation of this z-mode toward the past.

#### Imaginative Correction Toward the Future:

*   **(The Flow of the Future, t-Mode):** To reach the future goal of a ‘successful career,’ you construct a step-by-step narrative of a life plan (Flow): “First, I will learn this skill, then join that company, and finally, start my own business.”
*   **(The Structure of the Future, z-Mode):** An architect envisions the final ‘blueprint (Structure)’ of a building that does not yet exist. You perform a mundane prediction that the unseen back of your monitor has the ‘form (Structure)’ of various ports and manufacturer stickers.

Thus, t and z freely transcend time. The misunderstanding of ‘past=t, future=z’ arises simply from the tendency of our daily survival activities to primarily refer to the ‘flow of the past (t)’ to predict the ‘structure of the future (z).’

### A Case Study: The Perfect Duet of t (Flow) and z (Structure) in Architecture

To solidify our understanding of how these two modes operate independently of time, let’s consider the mind of an architect. Their goal is singular: ‘to build a safe and beautiful house.’

**1. The z-Mode (Structure Recognition): The “What” — A Static Blueprint**

*   **Essence:** This mode answers the question, “What should the finished house look like?”
*   **Operation:**
    *   It creates the final blueprint of the building. This is the z-mode in its purest form.
    *   It determines spatial relationships and static properties: the layout of each room, the precise position of pillars, the thickness of walls, the size of windows, and the angle of the roof.
    *   It analyzes the structural integrity of the entire system, asking questions like, “What is the relationship between this pillar and that one?” or “How will the load on this wall be distributed?”
*   **Output:** A static model, a blueprint, a diagram, an image of the final result. It is the big picture, perceived with time held still.

**2. The t-Mode (Flow Construction): The “How” — A Dynamic Execution Plan**

*   **Essence:** This mode answers the question, “How will that house be built?”
*   **Operation:**
    *   It lays out the construction process, a sequence of tasks ordered in time.
    *   It connects events in a causal and chronological sequence: “First, we lay the foundation, then we erect the pillars, and finally, we put up the roof.”
    *   It creates a narrative where one action becomes the cause or prerequisite for the next: “To erect the pillars, we must first transport the materials,” or “To put up the roof, scaffolding must be installed first.”
*   **Output:** A dynamic plan, a flowchart, a project timeline, a scenario. It is a sequence of actions unfolding over time.

**The Interaction: The Reality of ‘Flickering’**

As noted, these two are not separate. In an actual architect’s mind, these two modes ‘flicker’ back and forth, dozens or hundreds of times a second.

(z-Mode): The architect visualizes the completed structure (blueprint) of the house. “The pillar must be in that position.”

(t-Mode): “Ah, to erect a pillar in that position, I must first dig the ground.” (Thinking of the flow/process to realize the structure)

(z-Mode): While thinking about the digging process, they look at the whole structure again. “Wait, if I dig in that position, won’t it affect the stability of the adjacent building’s foundation?” (Analyzing the impact of the flow on the structure)

(t-Mode): “To solve the stability issue, I need to change the sequence: first, reinforce the adjacent building, then dig the ground.” (Revising the flow/sequence based on the structural analysis)

(z-Mode): Based on the revised flow, they re-examine the final structure. “Reinforcement work will change the overall cost structure. I need to re-budget.”

Thus, z (structure, What) and t (flow, How) constantly refer to, revise, and complement each other to move toward the goal.

z becomes the destination and constraint for t.
t becomes the path and execution plan to realize z.

Without t, there is no way to realize z. Without z, t has no direction to go. The subtle yet decisive difference lies, as pointed out, in the switch between the perspective of grasping static relationships and properties (z) and the perspective of constructing a dynamic sequence and process (t).

## Chapter 4: The Origin of ‘Flickering’ — The Inevitable Strategy of a Being Without a Foothold

Now we can return to the most fundamental question. Why is our intelligence fated to ‘Flicker’ — to ceaselessly oscillate between these two modes, ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure’?

The answer lies in the Vanished Present.

Because there is no stable foothold of the ‘present’ to rest upon, intelligence cannot be fixed anywhere. Having no place to stand, intelligence is forced to move endlessly. ‘Flickering’ is not one of many possible strategies; it is the one and only inevitable survival method that intelligence was forced to adopt to process information under the condition of the Vanished Present.

*   The moment you grasp structure (z-mode), flow stops. To clearly analyze and predict the static ‘structure’ of an object, you must pause the ever-changing ‘flow’ and fix the object into a single, static ‘snapshot.’ A structure becomes blurred in a dynamic state.
*   The moment you ride the flow (t-mode), structure blurs. To react to and experience the dynamic ‘flow’ of an object, you must stop analyzing its fixed structure and surrender to the change itself. A flow cannot be experienced in a static state.

These two modes are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the essence of intelligence is an endless process of ‘stopping to see structure, and moving to feel flow.’ The reason we feel as if we are performing interpolation and prediction simultaneously is only because this ‘Flickering’ is so fast that our consciousness cannot detect it.

And it is the very trajectory of this ‘Flickering’ that creates the sensation of a ‘linear flow of time’ within us. The irreversible information processing sequence of ‘construct Flow (t) → predict Structure (z) within it → reflect the result to construct a new Flow (t’) → …’ is the very Arrow of Time. Time is not an external constraint, but a shadow cast by the way our engine operates.

## Chapter 5: The Drama of the Gap — The Birthplace of The Self, Emotion, and Memory

This ‘Gap’ of the Flickering, created by the Vanished Present, is not a simple void. It is the ‘creative workshop’ where all our inner dramas unfold. Our Self, our emotions, and our memories are all born in this gap.

#### The Self is the Style of Flickering:

We have previously defined the ‘Self’ as a collection of ‘biases’ formed around a ‘Highest Value.’ We can now see its origin. A ‘bias’ is a pathway of ‘Imaginative Correction’ that has been automated to increase energy efficiency during the ‘Flickering’ process. Some people spend more energy constructing ‘Flow (t)’ (narrative-oriented people), while others spend more energy grasping ‘Structure (z)’ (analytical-oriented people). This unique ‘style of Flickering’ and the resulting sum of accumulated ‘biases’ is the very substance of what we call the ‘Self’ or ‘personality.’

#### Emotion is the Feedback Signal of Flickering:

Was the ‘Imaginative Correction’ successful or not? When an error (Prediction-Error) occurs between the interpolated ‘Flow (t)’ and the predicted ‘Structure (z),’ the system sends out a powerful feedback signal. This is ‘emotion.’

*   **Joy/Satisfaction:** When the prediction (z) and the actual result (t) align positively. “My predictive model was correct!”
*   **Surprise/Shock:** When the prediction (z) and the actual result (t) diverge significantly. “My model was completely wrong! This information is important and must be saved!”
*   **Anxiety/Fear:** When the prediction of the upcoming ‘Structure (z)’ is impossible or negative.

#### Memory is the Record of Flickering:

Not every moment of ‘Flickering’ is recorded equally. Only the moments when a strong ‘emotional’ feedback signal was generated — that is, moments of significant prediction-error — drop an ‘Anchor’ in the sea of memory. When we ‘recall the past,’ we are performing another ‘Imaginative Correction’ task: reconstructing a plausible ‘Flow (t)’ and ‘Structure (z)’ by connecting the scattered data fragments around these anchors. Memory is not a record of the past, but a reconstruction project carried out by the current ‘Flickering’ engine.

## Chapter 6: A Tightrope Walk in the Gap — The Reinterpretation of Free Will and Flow

The perspective of the Vanished Present sheds new light on the most profound human experiences: free will and a state of flow.

#### Free Will is Observation:

We cannot stop the ‘Flickering’ itself or control its direction at will. It is a fundamental condition of our existence. The only freedom we can possess is the ability to observe and be aware of our own ‘Flickering’ process, which is Metacognition. “I am leaning toward t-mode now,” or “My z-mode prediction is based on this bias.” This ‘Awareness’ does not liberate us from determinism. However, it becomes a new ‘input’ that influences our next ‘Flicker.’ We cannot change the laws of the system, but we can change the data that is fed into the law. This is the only, and the greatest, freedom we have.

#### Flow is Perfect Harmony:

A state of Flow is not a state where ‘Flickering’ stops. On the contrary, it is the state where ‘Flickering’ achieves its most perfect harmony. It is a state where, in a situation of some uncertainty, the ‘interpolation of Flow (t)’ and the ‘prediction of Structure (z)’ align almost perfectly and cycle at an extremely high speed. In other words, my prediction (z) instantly becomes reality (t’), and that reality, in turn, becomes the perfect basis for the next prediction (z’). It is a feedback loop where delay and error converge to almost ‘0’. At this moment, the gap between ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure’ disappears, and the consciousness of ‘I,’ the observer, also vanishes. All that remains is the act itself. In this moment of perfect ‘Imaginative Correction,’ we experience the most intense illusion of ‘continuous time.’

## Chapter 7: Why We Must Say the ‘Present’ Is Vanished — The Limits of Language and a New Realism

At the end of this long journey, we arrive at a paradoxical conclusion. The discussion of the Vanished Present completes itself through the following dialectical process.

**Thesis: The Present is Absent.**

Our perception always comes with a delay, processing only past data. What we experience is solely the afterimage of the past (interpolated Flow, t) and a prediction of the future (inferred Structure, z). Therefore, an experientially ‘pure present’ does not exist.

**Antithesis: Only the Present is Real.**

However, the ‘past’ is a story created by memory (interpolation), and the ‘future’ is an inference created by expectation (prediction). Both are ‘illusions’ generated by intelligence. If we erase these two illusions, what remains? Only the ‘process of processing’ itself, here and now. All interpolation and prediction occur on the ‘workbench’ of the present. From this perspective, only the present is real.

**Synthesis: The Present is Also Absent.**

Ultimately, if there are no comparison points of ‘past’ and ‘future,’ the word ‘present’ loses its meaning. The ‘present’ can only be defined as ‘not the past’ and ‘not the future.’ The ‘present itself,’ left after erasing all comparison points, is not a ‘point’ on the flow of time. It is the pure ‘State’ or ‘Field’ in which all possibilities are conceived, existing before the concept of time itself is born. This ‘State’ cannot be captured by the binary concepts of “is (existence)” or “is not (non-existence).” The very concepts of ‘is/is not’ only arise after intelligence focuses and weaves reality by distinguishing a ‘pattern (an existence)’ from this pure state. Therefore, to say ‘the present is also absent’ does not mean it is non-existent, but that it is the ‘fundamental reality that transcends the distinction between existence and non-existence.’

The ‘chicken and egg’ problem is finally resolved here. Within the framework of ‘linear time,’ the idea that intelligence and change create each other is a paradox. But in a ‘discontinuous world,’ it is not. They are not in a relationship of cause and effect, but emerge together in a pure ‘Mutual Constitution,’ at the very moment intelligence focuses to create reality.

## Conclusion

We are often told to ‘live in the present.’ However, as we have seen, there is no present — at least, not between the past and the future. It is like the concept of a ‘continuous point.’

But the Vanished Present is the most powerful key that liberates us from the prison of time.

We often live thinking of ourselves as the ‘sum of the past.’ We become arrogant from past successes and are shackled by past failures. But now we know. That ‘past’ is not a fixed entity, but a story that your present self is constantly reconstructing through the two modes of ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure.’

You are a product of the story you remember, but at the same time, you are the writer of that story.

We are not beings that exist, but processes that happen. We are the very ‘act of weaving’ itself, unfolding the threads of the ‘past’ to create the patterns of the ‘future’ on the empty stage of the ‘present,’ oscillating between ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure.’ You are not a static being, but a dynamic process.

The Vanished Present is right here.
