# The Vanished Present

*You Exist Only Between Flow and Structure*

### Preface: Where Do We Stand?
We believe we live in the present, here and now. This seems to be an unquestionable truth, the starting point and destination of all experience. But is the ground of this present truly solid? The *now* in which you are reading this sentence, the very moment you try to grasp it, has already crumbled into an afterimage of the past.

Is the *present* an infinitely thin blade between the past and the future, upon which we can never truly rest? Or is it the most fundamental illusion we have ever created, one that never existed in the first place?

This report deconstructs the greatest myth of all: the *present.* And on its ruins, it will reveal the fundamental mechanism by which we create the world through a *Flickering* — a ceaseless oscillation between two different realities, *Flow* and *Structure.* By the end of this journey, you will realize that we are not beings who belong to time, but the very process that creates it. And you will understand that the Vanished Present was the one and only condition under which our perception, emotions, Self, and the narrative we call life could have ever been born.

### Chapter 1: Imaginative Correction — The Single Engine at the Beginning of Everything
At the deepest core of all our perceptual activities lies a single, fundamental engine: *Imaginative Correction.* The sole and absolute mission of this engine is to fill the *Gaps* in the discontinuous and incomplete data we encounter, using the most plausible information to construct a complete reality.

This is not a philosophical speculation, but a physical reality of perception. It takes tens to hundreds of milliseconds (ms) for light to reach your retina and for that photochemical signal to travel through the optic nerve to be processed as an *image* in the visual cortex of your brain. The moment you *see* the monitor in front of you, you, the subject of that perception, are already living in a world that is hundreds of milliseconds in the *past.* The only thing we ever hold in our hands is past data.

The *present* never reaches our perceptual system. This is the physical proof of the Vanished Present.

How, then, can we catch a ball flying toward us in real-time or have a seamless conversation? It is because this *Imaginative Correction* engine works furiously to fill the fundamental information vacuum left by the Vanished Present. The engine takes the delayed past data and preemptively calculates the *state that is about to happen,* filling the gaps in reality. At this stage, time and space, interpolation and prediction, are still an undivided, integrated process.

### Chapter 2: The Origin of Differentiation — The Deep Dive into the tz-Theory
Our 3-dimensional cognitive system cannot process this integrated *Imaginative Correction* process all at once. Due to this cognitive limitation, the system divides this single engine into two different *Operational Modes,* depending on the type of *Gap* that needs to be filled. This is the difference in *perspective,* and it is the origin of the differentiation between t and z, the two realities we experience.

To clarify how our intelligence uses this single engine, let us explicitly define these two modes. This definition is a core promise that will run through the entire series.

**t-Mode: Flow Construction**
The core function of this mode is *Connecting.* It focuses on creating a smooth *Flow* or *Process* by assigning causal and narrative links between scattered pieces of information. The primary tool used here is Interpolation, and it answers the questions, “How did it flow to get here?” or “How will it flow to reach the goal?” Its output takes the form of stories, plans, and historical narratives.

**z-Mode: Structure Recognition**
The core function of this mode is *Grasping.* It focuses on identifying a static *Structure* or *Model* by extracting patterns and relationships from a set of information. The primary tools used here are Prediction and Abstraction, and it answers the questions, “What is its essence?” or “What is the whole picture?” Its output takes the form of analysis, judgment, and blueprints.

We must remember that *interpolation* and *prediction* are fundamentally one and the same. Both are ways in which the *Imaginative Correction* engine fills the gaps of our incomplete reality. We simply call it *t-mode* when we use the engine from the perspective of creating *Flow,* and we call it *z-mode* when we use it from the perspective of creating *Structure.*

### Chapter 3: Liberation from Time — The Two Modes Transcending Past and Future
The fact that t and z are *Modes of Focus* rather than axes of time reveals how free our mental activities are from the linear constraints of past, present, and future. These two modes are universal information processing methods that can operate at any point in time.

**Imaginative Correction Toward the Past:**
*   **(The Flow of the Past, t-Mode):** A historian connects various historical events with *causal links (Flow)* to create a grand historical narrative, such as, “The A event led to the B revolution.” You weave together the fragmented memories of last night to reconstruct a single, continuous story: “I made that mistake because I was drunk.”
*   **(The Structure of the Past, z-Mode):** An archaeologist finds a *hidden pattern (Structure)* among scattered artifacts to infer their identity: “This is a ritual tool from Civilization A.” You look back on a past relationship and analyze, “Our relationship had this imbalanced structure from the very beginning.” The act of ‘looking at myself objectively’ is precisely the operation of this z-mode toward the past.

**Imaginative Correction Toward the Future:**
*   **(The Flow of the Future, t-Mode):** To reach the future goal of a *successful career,* you construct a step-by-step narrative of a life plan (Flow): “First, I will learn this skill, then join that company, and finally, start my own business.”
*   **(The Structure of the Future, z-Mode):** An architect envisions the final *blueprint (Structure)* of a building that does not yet exist. You perform a mundane prediction that the unseen back of your monitor has the *form (Structure)* of various ports and manufacturer stickers.

Thus, t and z freely transcend time. The misunderstanding of ‘past=t, future=z’ arises simply from the tendency of our daily survival activities to primarily refer to the *flow of the past (t)* to predict the *structure of the future (z).*

#### A Case Study: The Perfect Duet of t (Flow) and z (Structure) in Architecture

To solidify our understanding of how these two modes operate independently of time, let’s consider the mind of an architect. Their goal is singular: ‘to build a safe and beautiful house.’

1.  **The z-Mode (Structure Recognition): The “What” — A Static Blueprint**
    *   **Essence:** This mode answers the question, “What should the finished house look like?”
    *   **Operation:** It creates the final blueprint of the building. This is the z-mode in its purest form. It determines spatial relationships and static properties.
    *   **Output:** A static model, a blueprint, a diagram. It is the big picture, perceived with time held still.

2.  **The t-Mode (Flow Construction): The “How” — A Dynamic Execution Plan**
    *   **Essence:** This mode answers the question, “How will that house be built?”
    *   **Operation:** It lays out the construction process, a sequence of tasks ordered in time. It connects events in a causal and chronological sequence.
    *   **Output:** A dynamic plan, a flowchart, a project timeline, a scenario. It is a sequence of actions unfolding over time.

**The Interaction: The Reality of *Flickering***
In an actual architect’s mind, these two modes *flicker* back and forth, hundreds of times a second.
*   **(z-Mode):** The architect visualizes the completed structure. “The pillar must be in that position.”
*   **(t-Mode):** “Ah, to erect a pillar in that position, I must first dig the ground.”
*   **(z-Mode):** While thinking about the digging process, they look at the whole structure again. “Wait, if I dig there, won’t it affect the adjacent building’s stability?”
*   **(t-Mode):** “To solve this, I need to change the sequence: first, reinforce the adjacent building, then dig.”
*   **(z-Mode):** Based on the revised flow, they re-examine the final structure. “Reinforcement work will change the cost structure. I need to re-budget.”

Thus, z (structure, What) and t (flow, How) constantly refer to, revise, and complement each other to move toward the goal. z becomes the destination and constraint for t; t becomes the path and execution plan to realize z.

### Chapter 4: The Origin of *Flickering* — The Inevitable Strategy of a Being Without a Foothold
Why is our intelligence fated to *Flicker* — to ceaselessly oscillate between these two modes, *Flow* and *Structure*?

The answer lies in the Vanished Present.

Because there is no stable foothold of the *present* to rest upon, intelligence cannot be fixed anywhere. Having no place to stand, intelligence is forced to move endlessly. *Flickering* is not one of many possible strategies; it is the one and only inevitable survival method.

*   The moment you grasp structure (z-mode), flow stops.
*   The moment you ride the flow (t-mode), structure blurs.

These two modes are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the essence of intelligence is an endless process of ‘stopping to see structure, and moving to feel flow.’ And it is the very trajectory of this *Flickering* that creates the sensation of a ‘linear flow of time’ within us. Time is not an external constraint, but a shadow cast by the way our engine operates.

### Chapter 5: The Drama of the Gap — The Birthplace of The Self, Emotion, and Memory
This *Gap* of the Flickering, created by the Vanished Present, is the ‘creative workshop’ where all our inner dramas unfold.

*   **The Self is the Style of Flickering:** A ‘bias’ is an automated pathway of *Imaginative Correction.* Some people are narrative-oriented (t-mode), while others are analytical (z-mode). This unique *style of Flickering* is the very substance of the *Self.*
*   **Emotion is the Feedback Signal of Flickering:** When an error occurs between the interpolated *Flow (t)* and the predicted *Structure (z),* the system sends out a powerful feedback signal. This is *emotion.*
*   **Memory is the Record of Flickering:** Only moments of significant prediction-error (strong emotion) drop an *Anchor* in the sea of memory. Memory is not a record of the past, but a reconstruction project carried out by the current *Flickering* engine.

### Chapter 6: A Tightrope Walk in the Gap — The Reinterpretation of Free Will and Flow
The perspective of the Vanished Present sheds new light on free will and a state of flow.

*   **Free Will is Observation:** We cannot stop the *Flickering.* The only freedom we have is the ability to be aware of our own *Flickering* process (Metacognition). We cannot change the laws of the system, but we can change the data that is fed into the law.
*   **Flow is Perfect Harmony:** A state of Flow is where *Flickering* achieves its most perfect harmony. My prediction (z) instantly becomes reality (t’), and that reality, in turn, becomes the perfect basis for the next prediction (z’). At this moment, the gap between *Flow* and *Structure* disappears, and the consciousness of *I,* the observer, also vanishes.

### Chapter 7: Why We Must Say the *Present* Is Vanished — The Limits of Language and a New Realism
The discussion of the Vanished Present completes itself through the following dialectical process.

1.  **Thesis: The Present is Absent.** We only experience the afterimage of the past (t) and a prediction of the future (z).
2.  **Antithesis: Only the Present is Real.** The ‘past’ and ‘future’ are illusions generated by intelligence. Only the ‘process of processing’ itself, here and now, is real.
3.  **Synthesis: The Present is Also Absent.** If there are no comparison points of ‘past’ and ‘future,’ the word ‘present’ loses its meaning. The ‘present itself’ is the pure ‘State’ or ‘Field’ existing before the concept of time itself is born, transcending the distinction between existence and non-existence.

The ‘chicken and egg’ problem is resolved here. Intelligence and change are not in a relationship of cause and effect; they emerge together in a pure *Mutual Constitution* at the very moment intelligence focuses to create reality.

### Conclusion
We are often told to ‘live in the present.’ However, as we have seen, there is no present — at least, not between the past and the future.

But the Vanished Present is the most powerful key that liberates us from the prison of time. We recreate the past through memory, and using that recreated past as a stepping stone, we imagine the future.

We are not beings that exist, but processes that happen. You are not a static being, but a dynamic process.

The Vanished Present is right here.
