# The Deconstruction of Morality

> Optimization for the Lazy; Weapon of the Powerful

### Preface: Commands That Are Not Sacred

"Thou shalt not kill."
"Thou shalt not steal."
"Thou shalt not break thy promises."

From the moment we are born, we live surrounded by these propositions. From table-side manners taught by parents to moral textbooks in schools, and the scriptures of millennia-old religions, these propositions are injected into us as absolute **'Oughts'** that must never be questioned. We believe that keeping them is the only way to become a 'good person,' and whenever we feel the desire to break them, we whip ourselves with the internal lash of 'guilt.' Of course, as society became more complex, the most fatal of these oughts gained the physical force of 'Law,' but even before the law, this invisible, colossal code—**'Morality'**—has always governed us.

However, **HumanEngineering (HE)** creates a precise crack in the foundation of this solid belief. We ask: Are these commands truly sacred truths fallen from the sky? Or are they noble resonances inherently engraved in the depths of human nature?

This report deconstructs that illusion. We will prove that morality is not a sublime value, but a **'social efficiency protocol designed for the survival of the system (human)'** in a discontinuous and dangerous world. Furthermore, we will trace how this efficient tool has been contaminated by power over time, becoming a **'Bug'** that paralyzes the system's computational capacity in the modern era.

Let it be clear: this is not an act of sabotage to abolish morality and return to chaos. This is the most precise engineering operation to disassemble the rusty, old machine called morality and rescue the real engine hidden within it—**'Ethics.'**

### Chapter 1. The Origin of Morality: Not a Peace Treaty, but a 'Ceasefire Agreement'

Where did morality come from? This is not a subject for exhaustive philosophical debates like "is human nature good or evil." The origin of morality is strictly a matter of **'Physics'** and **'Economics'**—that is, a matter of **'Energy Efficiency.'** Morality began with ethics.

#### 1.1. The Inefficiency of the State of Nature: The Cost of Infinite Vigilance
Before the advent of civilization and rules, the individual system known as a human faced the desperate task of preserving its 'First External World (The Body),' as defined in **<The Engineering of The Body>**. In this state, 'The Other' was not a 'neighbor,' but a **'Great Uncertainty (Chaos)'** and a **'Black Box'** possessing physical force that could threaten one's survival.

If every entity acted solely according to its desire—its Will to Control—what would happen? A “war of all against all” becomes the default condition. However, what HumanEngineering focuses on is not the cruelty of the struggle, but its **'extreme inefficiency.'** One would have to be vigilant against someone stealing their food while eating, and grip a knife while sleeping for fear of having their throat slit. In other words, the **'Monitoring Cost'** required for survival skyrockets to infinity. In this state, no system can accumulate surplus energy to build a civilization.

#### 1.2. Calculation of Cost-Benefit and the Ceasefire
At some point, entities with high intelligence began to calculate.
"The Gain I get from ambushing him and taking his resources is far less than the Risk (Cost) of me being ambushed, injured, or killed while I sleep."

As a result of this calculation, they signed a **'Ceasefire Agreement'** to dramatically lower each other's survival costs. This did not stem from love or mercy. It was rooted in cold strategic calculation.

*   "I will not kill you, so you must not kill me. Also, keep in mind that you can be avenged by the bereaved at any time." (The Birth of the Right to Life)
*   "If you do not touch my property, I will not touch yours. Keep in mind that stealing can lead to retaliation at any time." (The Birth of Property Rights)

Through this agreement, humans were finally able to save the energy spent on 'infinite vigilance' and invest it in 'production.' This is the physical reality of **'Rights.'**

#### 1.3. Internalization of Rules: Automated Protocols
However, even with the agreement, calculating "Should I kill him? Is it profitable to keep the agreement?" every time one met another person still consumed the brain's computational resources.
So, social evolution chose to install the content of this agreement as a **'Default Protocol'** in the unconscious area of the brain. To make one feel "Killing is wrong" reflexively, without calculating every time.

That is the birth of moral law. Morality is not the expression of innate goodness, but an **'Insurance Policy'** collectively subscribed to by humanity to guarantee **'Maximum Survival at Minimum Cost,'** and an **'Automated Control Device'** hard-coded to reduce computational costs.

### Chapter 2. The Distinction Between Ethics and Morality: Source Code vs. Compressed File

We often use Ethics and Morality interchangeably, but in the HumanEngineering framework, these two have completely different **'Data Layers'** and **'Modes of Operation.'** This distinction is the beginning of all deconstruction.

#### 2.1. Ethics: Real-time Computational Engine (Source Code)
As defined in **<The Engineering of Ethics>**, ethics is a **'intelligent computational process'** running in real-time within the system.
*   **Operation:** It balances the symmetry between one's desire (Input) and the result of action (Output), and simulates spacetime (t-axis) and structure (z-axis) to find the optimal solution for the current situation.
*   **Feature:** Fluid. The answer changes according to the environmental variable. For example, it derives the conclusion that "Killing is bad, but killing in self-defense to protect my survival (1st Value) from someone trying to kill me now is systemically justified."
*   **Cost:** It consumes a lot of energy because it must run complex simulations at every moment. (**High Computing Cost**)

#### 2.2. Morality: Pre-calculated Result (Cached Data)
Morality is an **'Answer Sheet pre-calculated and fixed'** by society for situations where it is difficult to run the ethics engine, or for the majority of members who lack the capacity (or time) to compute the t-axis and z-axis.
*   **Operation:** It follows a simple command like "If A, then B" without considering complex causality.
*   **Feature:** Fixed. It applies rules without regard to the situation. "Killing is evil, regardless of the reason."
*   **Cost:** It consumes almost no energy because one just needs to memorize and follow it. (**Bias**)

#### 2.3. The Essence of the Relationship: Cache for 'Efficiency,' Not 'Laziness'
At this point, we must redefine the expression "The Lazy" in the subtitle. Following morality was not due to indolence, but a highly evolved strategy to save computational energy for survival.
Just as a computer stores frequently used data in **'Cache Memory'** for quick access instead of computing it in the CPU every time, human society has compressed (zipped) the ethical calculation results for frequently occurring problems (murder, theft, adultery, etc.) into the form of 'morality' and stored them.

Even for a highly intelligent person, performing ethical calculations for every action is exhausting and inefficient. So, usually, they call up 'Morality (Cache)' to act quickly, and only turn on 'Ethics (Engine)' in complex dilemma situations that morality cannot resolve.
In other words, morality is a compressed file that omits the detailed context of ethics and leaves only the **'Principles'** for the sake of **'social convenience and energy efficiency.'**

#### 2.4. Deep Dive: Morality as 'Social Ego'
At this point, we must recall the definition from **'The Engineering of The Self'**. What is the individual Self? It is an aggregate of **'Bias'** formed to protect core values, and **'Stubbornness'** to maintain that bias.

Expanding this structure to the social level reveals the true nature of morality. **Morality is the 'Social Ego.'**

*   **Social Bias:** Solidified past experiential data stating, "Our society survives by doing this."
*   **Social Stubbornness:** A firewall that refuses to update, insisting on "keeping tradition" despite environmental changes.

Therefore, morality is not absolute Truth, but merely the **'Collective Personality'** and **'Ego'** of that society.

---

### Chapter 3. The Distinction Between Morality and Law: Internal Police vs. External Police

Then, how are morality and law different? Both are rules that maintain society, but their **'Interface'** and **'Enforcement Mechanism'** are different.

#### 3.1. Law: Enforcement of Physical Cost (Hard Power)
Law is a rule enforced by the massive external power called the **'State,'** backed by physical force (police, prison, fines).
*   **Function:** It is the **'Final Firewall'** and **'Hardware Constraint'** to prevent fatal bugs (murder, robbery, fraud) that can destroy the system.
*   **Mechanism:** By showing a **'Certain and Immediate Physical Loss (Penalty)'** like "If you break it, you go to prison," it forces even entities with low intelligence who cannot calculate the future (t-axis) to immediately recognize the risk. Law is a mandatory cognitive filter that prevents self-deception.

#### 3.2. Morality: Induction of Psychological Cost (Soft Power)
Morality covers the subtle and private areas that physical force cannot reach. If the law builds the skeleton, morality is like the muscle filling the gaps.
*   **Function:** It manages daily interactions (manners, filial piety, friendship, lying) that would be too costly for society if regulated individually by law.
*   **Mechanism:** It charges psychological costs such as **'Loss of Reputation'** ("You are a bad person") and **'Guilt (Internal Alarm).'** This is a sophisticated control technique that takes human **'Social Ego (Reputation System)'** and **'Self-image'** hostage.

### Chapter 4. Religion and Culture that Ruled the Past: Setting Administrator Privileges

How can this cache memory called 'Morality' be installed in the brains of all members of society? Persuading individuals logically is nearly impossible. The cost is too high. So, past system administrators (ruling class, prophets) set **'Admin Authority'** on this file that could not be deleted. That is religion and culture.

#### 4.1. Religion: The Compilation from Insight to Doctrine
Here, we must make a crucial distinction: the difference between the **'Original Teachings'** of the founders and the **'Institutional Doctrines'** established by later generations.
*   **Source Code (Ethics):** The original messages of figures like Jesus or Buddha were high-level **'Ethical Calculations'** (e.g., universal love, non-self) derived from deep insight into the structure of the world.
*   **Compiled File (Morality):** However, to disseminate this to the masses and maintain organizations, later power structures compressed these insights into simple **'Commands'** and locked them with **'Admin Authority.'**
    *   Insight: "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Symmetry)
    *   Doctrine: "Obey the church, or go to hell." (Power)

In the era before **<The Deconstruction of Modernism>**, this 'Digital Signature' called **'God's Command'** exerted overwhelming efficiency in controlling the masses. HE deconstructs this fossilized doctrine, not the original insight.

#### 4.2. Culture: Formation of the Collective Unconscious
Where there was no religion, **'Tradition'** and **'Culture'** took its place.
The phrase "Our ancestors have done so for generations" implies, "This rule is data verified (advantageous for survival) by countless people over hundreds of years."
For example, the reason 'Filial Piety (Hyo)' was an absolute morality in agrarian society was that the experiential data of the elderly who possessed farming know-how was essential for survival. Culture is the **'Survival Optimization Algorithm'** of that era solidified into a collective unconscious.

In short, morality has existed as the ego of tradition and culture—as manners and virtues which are biases and stubbornness.

### Chapter 5. Moral Laws Derived from Ethics: The Fossilization of Protocols

Morality did not fall from the sky. Many moral laws we consider 'sacred' are not eternal Truths derived from spiritual insight, but **'Doctrines'** and **'results of ethical calculations'** optimized for the survival and prosperity of the group under the environmental variables of the time.

#### 5.1. Dietary Taboos: Hygiene Protocols turned into Doctrine
Consider the commandment "Do not eat pork" in Islam or Judaism. This is not a mystical will of God. It is a strict **'Hygiene Protocol'** solidified into Doctrine.
*   **Calculation at the time (Ethics):** In the hot climate of the Middle East, pork spoiled and was infected with parasites faster than other meats. Eating this would threaten the group with food poisoning and loss of labor force (Cost).
*   **Doctrinization (Morality):** Leaders packaged this hygienic conclusion into a powerful taboo: **"The pig is an unclean animal, so do not eat it."** A practical survival strategy was disguised as a religious commandment.

#### 5.2. Sexual Morality: Resource Management turned into Doctrine
What about strict sexual morality like "Keep your chastity" or "Monogamy"? This, too, is less an insight into human nature and more a Doctrine for **'Social Resource Management.'**
*   **Calculation at the time (Ethics):** In an era without contraception or paternity testing technology, promiscuous sex mass-produced 'children who could not be supported,' depleting the community's resources, or maximizing genetic risks.
*   **Doctrinization (Morality):** System administrators framed this as **"Lewdness is a sin."** Socioeconomic risk management was packaged as a virtue to efficiently suppress individual desires.

### Chapter 6. The Danger and Distortion of Fixed Moral Laws: The Curse of Legacy Code

The problem is that the environment changes, but morality (rules) is **'sacralized'** and does not change. Here, morality degenerates from a useful tool into **'Legacy Code'** that holds the system back.

#### 6.1. Failure of Update: Occurrence of Bugs
In the modern era where refrigeration technology has developed, "Prohibition of Pork" is no longer a rule for survival. In an era where contraception and DNA testing are possible, repressive sexual morality of the past becomes a shackle that unnecessarily suppresses individual freedom (Sense of Control).
The moment the optimal solution of the past becomes the **'Inefficiency'** of the present, morality begins to oppress humans rather than help them. This is **'Social Dementia.'** It is a state where society cannot process new information, is trapped in past memories (rules), and screams because it cannot adapt to the changed reality.

#### 6.2. Hacking by Power: "Be Loyal"
A more fatal problem occurs when power uses this old morality to **'Hack'** the system. Since morality is a **'Public Server'** accessed by all members of society, it is the most attractive target for those in power.
*   **Hacking of Devotion:** The state hacks the natural calculation of **'Filial Piety'** (essential in agrarian families) and replaces it with **'State Loyalty'** or **'Patriotism.'** By framing the nation as a **'Fatherland,'** it packages **"individuals sacrificing their lives for the ruler"** as a sublime morality.
*   **Distortion of Work Ethic:** Morality like "Poverty is integrity and diligence is a virtue" can become **'Gaslighting'** injected by capitalists to work laborers more for less cost.

At this time, morality becomes not 'consideration for others,' but a **'hypnotic tool that makes the weak voluntarily obey the strong.'**

#### 6.3. Laundering of Responsibility: The Paradox of Guilt by Association
Power even erases its responsibility in the name of morality. Modern law and morality define **'Guilt by Association'** as barbarism, saying "Sin belongs to the individual."
However, from the perspective of **<The Engineering of Ethics>**, this can be a sophisticated **'Laundering of Responsibility'** where the powerful pass on the wealth (benefit) accumulated through unjust means to their families, while settling the responsibility (cost) only with their own punishment.
Ignoring the physical causality that "Responsibility flows where benefit flows," and preserving unjust gains by hiding behind the moral shield of 'Human Rights.' This is the starkest example of morality becoming a weapon of power.

#### 6.4. The Mechanism of Moral Update: Struggle, Not Favor
How does morality change? We often believe that slavery was abolished and racism disappeared because humanity's conscience evolved. But the HumanEngineering truth is much colder. The update of morality occurs only when there is a **'Power Shift.'**
*   **Victory of Black Civil Rights:** This was not because the morality of whites suddenly improved. It was because black people struggled with blood and sweat, physically proving to the system that **"the cost of ignoring us is greater than the cost of respecting us."** In other words, they succeeded in recognizing their share in the 'struggle of all against all' and signing a **'New Ceasefire Agreement (Ethics).'** This is a legitimate victory.
*   **Fossilization of New Morality:** However, the moment the victorious ethics hardens into 'Morality (Rule),' another contradiction arises. Current 'Political Correctness (PC)' provides excessive convenience to black people, but is insensitive to the suffering of Asians or Latinos in similar situations.
    *   **Reason:** Asians or Latinos have not yet demonstrated as much **'Political Power (Numbers, Fighting Power)'** to the system as black people have.
    *   **Result:** Morality reveals itself not as universal justice, but as a **'Biased Ledger prioritizing the interests of the loud (powerful).'** Morality strictly follows the perspective of 'The Engineering of Power.' Only the victors become morality.

### Chapter 7. The Contradiction of Morality in the Modern Era: Witch Hunt as Entertainment

After **<The Deconstruction of Modernism>**, 'God (Central Server),' who guaranteed morality, died. As central authority disappeared, morality fragmented like a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network, and now we live in an era where **'Numbers (Likes)'** determine justice. In this chaos, morality degenerates bizarrely.

#### 7.1. Weaponization of Morality: "I am Right and You are Wrong"
The modern public uses morality not to 'protect themselves' but to **'attack others.'**
When they capture a celebrity's trivial slip of the tongue and criticize it collectively, they fall into the illusion that they are realizing justice. But in reality, they are merely playing a **'Cheap Game of Gaining Sense of Control'** to confirm their moral superiority by tearing others down. This is not morality; it is **'Entertainment.'**

#### 7.2. The Peak of Asymmetry: Double Standards
The characteristic of this offensive morality is thorough **'Asymmetry.'** They apply a microscope-like standard to others and criticize them, but apply an infinitely generous standard to themselves and rationalize.
"I couldn't help it, but you shouldn't do that." ("Rules for thee, but not for me.")
This is the epitome of **'Deception'** described in **<The Engineering of Ethics>**, meaning that morality has become a **'Social Toxin'** that promotes distrust and hatred rather than helping social integration. The issue of AI censorship is the same. "I don't watch it, so you shouldn't either" is not ethics, but an **'Exercise of Power'** forcing one's taste on others.

---

### Chapter 8. The Restoration of Morality and the Role of Ethics: The Engineer's Stance

Then, should we abolish morality? No. As agreed in Chapter 1, we need efficient traffic signals to control traffic. However, we must become **'Users'** of morality, not **'Slaves.'**

#### 8.1. Auto Mode: Utilize as Cache Memory
In everyday situations, that is, moments where energy efficiency is important, follow existing morality and laws. "Stand in line," "Greet others," "Do not steal." This is the most efficient way to save computational energy and reduce social friction costs. Living ordinarily is not cowardly; it is efficient.

#### 8.2. Manual Mode: Re-activating the Ethics Engine
However, when morality conflicts with my essential values (freedom, survival), or is used as a tool to unjustly oppress someone (detection of contamination), or when an inexplicable 'discomfort' is detected in my mind, we must turn off **'Auto Pilot (Morality)'** and start **'Manual Driving (Ethics).'**

*   **Switching Trigger:** Is symmetry broken? (Am I forcing on others what I do not want to suffer?)
*   **Re-calculation:** "Is this rule still valid? Whose interest is this for? Am I ready to pay the cost (criticism, punishment) I must bear when I break this rule?"

#### 8.3. Redefining the Role of Law: The Final Cognitive Filter
In this process, the law plays an important role. Law is an **'Objective Coordinate'** that prevents us from falling into self-rationalization (Deception).
When you want to kick a robot and try to rationalize, "It's okay because robots have no feelings," the law coldly warns, "That is property damage." This warning asks us: **"Do you want to kick that thing even at the cost of becoming a criminal?"**
If it makes you stop before this question, the law has functioned as an excellent **'Cognitive Firewall.'**

### Conclusion: Do Not Be a Good Person, Be an Awakened System

We have been crushed for too long by the words "Be a moral person." But the reality of that morality was a mixture of the needs of the times, the desires of power, and the laziness of the masses. It is not your sin.

HumanEngineering proposes:
Do not try to be a blindly good person. Instead, be an awakened engineer at every moment.

Do not blindly trust the rules (Morality) injected by the world, but simulate the situation with your Intelligence.
Do not obey out of fear of others' gaze, but make a choice that is honorable in your Ledger (Settlement).
And when the result of that choice turns out to be a failure, do not cowardly blame society or others, but honestly pay the cost.

Thus, constantly update the old morality with your **'Ethics.'**
True morality is not in solidified textbooks, but in the field, in the result values produced by the sweat of your intelligence, agonizing fiercely and willing to take responsibility.

That honest calculation is the only way to not lose yourself in this chaotic world, protect yourself, and coexist with others.
And if, at the end of that fierce calculation, **'Goodness'** happens to be the optimal solution, accept it as a fortunate byproduct. But remember: it is merely a result of efficiency, never the goal itself.
