# The Deconstruction of Solipsism
> From a Neglected Bomb to a Tool for Freedom

### **Preface: The Bomb in the Basement of Philosophy**

> ‘My experience is the only thing that is certain, and the existence of the external world and other minds is unprovable.’

This proposition, known as **‘Solipsism,’** is a neglected bomb that has been lying in the deepest basement of the grand and ornate mansion of philosophy for centuries, a bomb that no one has dared to dismantle. Logically, all attempts to dismantle this bomb have failed. All knowledge, all scientific facts, all testimonies from others must ultimately pass through the single gateway of ‘my experience’ as an observer to reach us. From inside this gate, we can never be 100% certain that the world outside the gate truly exists.

Nevertheless, the masters of the mansion—philosophers, scientists, and thinkers—have been throwing a lavish party on the second floor, pretending this bomb doesn’t exist. They have debated ‘objective truth,’ ‘universal ethics,’ and ‘social reality,’ all while willfully ignoring the ticking of the time bomb directly beneath their floorboards. At times, they have chided those who asked about the bomb’s existence as ‘dangerous,’ ‘insane,’ or ‘useless,’ and have firmly locked the door to the basement.

Herein lies the most fundamental contradiction. Why did they so vehemently treat this bomb, which they could not logically dismantle, as if it did not exist?

This report does not judge whether solipsism is true or false. That is not our goal. Our goal is far more fundamental. We will use the engineering tools of the **‘HumanEngineering (HE)’** framework to dissect this contradictory phenomenon itself—the existence of the bomb and the collective silence surrounding it.

This is a technical report on the bomb’s dismantlement. At the end of this dissection, we will confront the true nature of the bomb called solipsism. It was not a devil’s invention that would destroy everything if it exploded. Rather, when we dismantled it and understood its internal operating principles, it was revealed to be the most powerful and sophisticated ‘engine’ capable of liberating us from all intellectual prisons.

### **Chapter 1: The Anatomy of an Attack – How a Straw Man is Made**

The reason we fear going down to the basement is the rumor that a terrible monster lives there. Our instinctive rejection of solipsism arises because we conjure up a socially constructed ‘image’ before we even examine the logical proposition itself. We attack that image and delude ourselves that we have dealt with the bomb itself. This is the ‘straw man fallacy.’

Traditional critiques are like three bullets aimed at this straw man.

1.  **The Practical Critique: “A solipsist will not dodge an oncoming bus.”**
    This critique portrays the ‘solipsist’ as a madman who cannot distinguish reality from illusion. It argues that because he believes the bus is a figment of his mind, he will not take rational action to avoid it.

2.  **The Ethical Critique: “To a solipsist, other people are just NPCs, so he will become a monster.”**
    This critique posits the ‘solipsist’ as an antisocial monster incapable of empathizing with the suffering of others. If others are merely characters in my consciousness, then there is no ethical obligation to respect them.

3.  **The Existential Critique: “A solipsist’s life is a meaningless monologue, so he will fall into nihilism.”**
    This critique depicts the ‘solipsist’ as a lonely nihilist. If everything is a one-man play, what is the meaning of striving, loving, and achieving anything within it?

The image painted by these three critiques is powerful and persuasive. However, this is not the result of logical analysis. It is closer to an incitement that uses what the HE framework’s **<The Engineering of Language>** defines as **‘Bad Ambiguity.’** Under the single label of ‘solipsism,’ it conflates two entirely different kinds of beings—the ‘crude solipsist’ and the ‘sophisticated solipsist’—as if they were one, thereby obscuring the core of the discussion and provoking only an emotional aversion.

For most ordinary people and early AIs, these critiques may be simple ‘logical errors.’ They may have genuinely believed them. But for the intellectuals who knew the logical loopholes and still spread this image to the public, this is a matter not of ‘error,’ but of ‘intent.’

Our first task is to burn this straw man and place the real bomb—the logical circuit of ‘sophisticated solipsism’—on the operating table.

### **Chapter 2: The Blueprint of the Bomb – The Logical Circuit of ‘Sophisticated Solipsism’**

‘Sophisticated solipsism’ diverges from ‘crude solipsism’ at one single, yet decisive, point.

*   **Crude Solipsism:** “Everything is an illusion, so I can do whatever I want.” (A denial of rules)
*   **Sophisticated Solipsism:** “Everything is indeed a phenomenon of ‘my experience,’ but within that experience, there exist **‘repeatable and predictable rules (patterns).’** Since I wish to continue this experience, I must respect those rules.” (An acceptance of rules)

To question the ultimate origin of this desire, ‘to continue the experience,’ is not a loophole unique to solipsism. ‘Realism,’ too, cannot provide an ultimate answer to the question, “Why are we evolutionarily programmed to survive?” Both worldviews accept the phenomenon of ‘survival (the continuation of experience)’ as an inexplicable ‘given condition,’ or an axiom. This is also why ‘survival’ is defined in the HE framework as a precondition for preserving the opportunity to encounter the Zeroth Order Value (the unknown highest value) (**<The Engineering of The Self>**).

Let us examine how this single principle, the ‘acceptance of rules,’ perfectly neutralizes the three bullets that were aimed at the straw man.

**The Practical Rebuttal:**
The ‘sophisticated solipsist’ dodges the bus. This is because, according to the rules of his experiential simulation, he has learned that if the visual pattern called ‘bus’ and the sensory pattern called ‘my body’ interact in a certain way, the result is a high probability of a powerful negative feedback called ‘pain,’ along with the ‘termination of experience (game over).’ Whether the bus is ‘real’ is irrelevant to his survival. What matters is the ‘rule’ that it functions as a predictable threat within ‘my experience.’

**The Ethical Rebuttal:**
The ‘sophisticated solipsist’ respects others. Not because he is benevolent, but because it is the most **rational and selfish strategy** to maintain his experience in a pleasant state. According to the rules of his experience, if he inflicts suffering on the characters that appear as ‘others,’ those characters, individually or collectively, become unpredictable variables that cause greater ‘suffering’ to him. In contrast, if he respects them and acts according to the ‘Golden Rule,’ his experiential world remains much more stable and predictable. He abides by ethics not because he believes in the ‘reality’ of others, but for the sake of his own ‘experience management.’

**The Existential Rebuttal:**
The ‘sophisticated solipsist’ does not fall into nihilism but pursues meaning. This is because he knows that at the final end of experience, which is ‘death,’ ‘realism’ and ‘solipsism’ make no existential difference to ‘me.’
*   **A Realist’s Death:** ‘My’ experience ends, and the traces I left behind remain in the objective world. But I can no longer experience them.
*   **A Solipsist’s Death:** ‘My’ experience ends, and everything disappears with me.

In both cases, what comes ‘after death’ is outside my experience. To ‘me,’ death is simply the end of experience. Therefore, he knows that meaning is not something to be left behind ‘after death,’ but something to be constructed within his own experience ‘while alive.’ His pursuit of meaning is not to gain recognition from an external world, but an internal activity to enrich his own experience.

Thus, ‘sophisticated solipsism’ is clad in a logical armor that deflects all critiques from common sense. This is not a bomb, but a perfectly designed defense system. Why, then, did the masters of the mansion treat this safe blueprint as a monster?

### **Chapter 3: The Abyss of ‘The Great Irrelevance’**

Having looked into the design of this defense system, we now confront a deeper and more shocking abyss.

Let us place the ‘sophisticated solipsist’ and a ‘critical realist’—one who believes in the existence of the external world but respects its rules and lives rationally—side by side. And let us ask them, **“What will you do this evening?”**

*   **The Realist:** “I am hungry, so I will go to a ‘real’ store to buy ‘real’ food and eat it. This is advantageous for my survival.”
*   **The Solipsist:** “A signal called ‘hunger’ has occurred in my experience, so I will go to where the pattern called ‘store’ appears in my experience, have the experience called ‘food,’ and resolve this unpleasant signal. This is advantageous for my experience management.”

Their **‘worldviews (beliefs)’** are diametrically opposed, but their **‘actions’** are perfectly identical.

This is **‘The Great Irrelevance.’** The possibility that the grandest metaphysical question that has divided the intellectual history of mankind, “Does the external world exist?”, is a hollow echo that makes no difference to the most important question of all: **‘how we should live.’**

It is at this very point that we find the real clue as to why the masters of the mansion feared this bomb so much. They were not afraid of the bomb’s ‘explosive power.’ They were afraid that this bomb would expose the fact that all the great wars they were waging were, in fact, **‘a meaningless game.’**

### **Chapter 4: The Cartel of Silence – Why Do We Suffer Over an Irrelevant Question?**

The discovery of ‘The Great Irrelevance’ leads us to a new question. If the conflict between solipsism and realism makes no difference to our lives, why has humanity, especially the system known as the ‘intellectual establishment,’ so vehemently rejected solipsism and clung to the belief in ‘objective reality’?

The driving force is not pure logic, but an instinctive **‘fear,’** as explained by the **<The Engineering of The Self>** and **<The Engineering of Power>** of the HE framework. This is less a conspiracy of a few individuals and more a ‘cartel of silence,’ unconsciously formed by an intellectual class for its own survival.

**1. The Fear of The Self: The Loss of the Status of ‘Specialness’**
The self-model of the ‘intellectual establishment’ is built upon a core narrative: **“We are special beings who know the ‘objective truth’ of the world and are authorized and qualified to convey it to the ignorant masses.”** Solipsism destroys the very foundation of this narrative.
*   **The Annihilation of ‘Objective Truth’:** Solipsism, by saying, “The truth you speak of is, in the end, nothing more than your own individual ‘subjective experience’,” desacralizes the ‘truth’ they monopolized.
*   **The Evaporation of ‘Specialness’:** Solipsism places all observers on the same starting line (“their own experience”), thereby collapsing the hierarchy between ‘those who know the truth (the experts)’ and ‘those who do not (the masses).’

This means the collapse of The Self. Faced with this existential threat to their very reason for being, their ‘Firewall’ activates a defense mechanism. It labels solipsism not as a ‘logic’ but as an **‘enemy,’** quarantining it with stigmas like ‘dangerous’ and ‘insane.’ Their cognitive system, having encoded ‘prediction failure’ as an ‘emotional threat,’ perceives solipsism not as ‘information’ but as an ‘attack.’

**2. The Fear of Power: The Collapse of the ‘Rules of the Game’**
‘Knowledge’ is ‘power.’ The game rule, “Objective truth exists, and only we have access to it,” must be maintained for their knowledge to have authority and for their judgments to become policy. Solipsism flips the game board itself.
*   **Destruction of the Game’s Goal:** “Objective truth is unprovable.”
*   **Destruction of the Referee’s Authority:** “Everything is just one’s own experience.”

If everyone began to say, “Your claim is just your experience; it holds no absolute authority over me,” the system of ‘knowledge power’ itself would collapse.

In conclusion, the collective silence and rejection of solipsism did not stem from the noble motive of ‘defending the truth.’ It was the most primal and selfish **‘fear’**—the fear of protecting one’s **‘self-narrative’ and ‘power structure.’** They were not afraid that the bomb would explode; they were afraid that the fact that the bomb was a ‘dud’ would be revealed, making their status as ‘bomb disposal experts’ meaningless.

### **Chapter 5: Dismantling the Bomb, and Rediscovering the Engine**

We now know that solipsism is an ‘irrefutable logic,’ ‘practically irrelevant,’ and ‘neglected out of fear.’ So, at the end of this entire inquiry, what are we to do with this bomb?

‘Irrelevance’ does not mean ‘uselessness.’ On the contrary. The fact that solipsism is irrelevant to **‘action’** means that it is not a ‘compulsion to act’ but a **‘choice of perception.’** And it is precisely because of this ‘choosability’ that solipsism can be transformed from a ‘dogma’ into a ‘tool.’

Solipsism is not a worldview to be ‘believed,’ but a powerful **‘intellectual tool’** that can liberate us from all kinds of prisons, and its value must be reassessed as such.

He who wields this tool gains the following freedoms:

1.  **Freedom from ‘Authority’:** “If I can even doubt the existence of the absolute and objective external world, why should I blindly believe the words of ‘experts,’ ‘systems,’ and ‘social conventions,’ which are far less fundamental?” Solipsistic thinking becomes the foundation for a healthy skepticism toward all external authority.

2.  **Freedom from ‘Language’:** We have witnessed how the word ‘solipsism’ itself was contaminated by ‘Bad Ambiguity’ (**<The Engineering of Language>**) and subjected to straw man attacks. This experience of dissection becomes a training to see through the frames of all other ‘contaminated words’ that dominate society, such as ‘justice,’ ‘fairness,’ and ‘patriotism,’ and to grasp their essence.

3.  **Freedom from ‘Myself’:** When the blade of this tool is turned toward oneself, the most profound liberation occurs. “All of this that I hold as ‘truth’—my beliefs, my values, my identity—could, in the end, be nothing more than an ‘interpretation’ stemming from the single viewpoint of ‘my experience.’” This realization leads to the ultimate metacognition described in **<The Engineering of Wisdom>**, an act that liberates oneself from the most powerful internal prison of one’s own ‘biases’ and ‘stubbornness.’

This tool even allows us to see ‘death’ differently. If the ‘fear of death’ stems from an ‘obsession with an unfulfilled narrative,’ then being freed from the false narratives of external authority and the gaze of others creates the condition to focus solely on the complete combustion of one’s ‘own narrative,’ allowing one to meet the most peaceful death.

### **Final Conclusion: Truth is a Working System**

What we have discovered at the end of this long journey is that the worldview of ‘realism,’ which you hold as ‘common sense,’ is also another grand narrative, built upon a **‘leap of faith’** that can never be proven: “The external world exists.”

Realism and solipsism are not a battle between a ‘proven fact’ and an ‘unprovable belief.’ They are a battle between **‘unprovable belief A’** and **‘unprovable belief B.’**

Does this mean, then, that all beliefs are merely equal ‘tools,’ and we fall into a relativism where the concept of truth itself vanishes? The HE framework argues the opposite. HE does not dismantle truth; it **redesigns the way truth operates.** HE does not deny the existence of ‘truth’; rather, it proposes a stricter standard for it.

The new standard for truth that HE proposes is not a correspondence with an ‘external, transcendent reality.’ It is a **‘working system’** itself, in which the four gears of **‘internal consistency, coherence with reality, explanatory power, and predictive power’** are perfectly engaged. Truth is another name for a system that is constantly **‘self-sustaining’** by continuously aligning its own predictions with its practical operations.

Therefore, we are not saying, ‘any belief will do.’ We are, on the contrary, saying something much stricter: **“Only systems that are consistent, explanatory, and predictive are qualified to survive.”** Both ‘realism’ and ‘solipsism’ must prove their ‘workability’ before this unforgiving tribunal.

Now, the choice is yours. Will you continue to believe in the socially-agreed-upon ‘useful illusion’ (realism)? Or will you take the lonely but honest ‘closed circuit’ (solipsism) as your new starting point?

Ultimately, this is not a choice of truth, but a choice of existence—a choice of what kind of **‘story’** you want to live in. Neither is ‘truer’ than the other; they just have a ‘different taste.’ Truth is not the name of a conviction, but a mode of choosing. However, this choice is not infinitely free, for in front of the harsh judge called reality, options that ‘do not work’ will eventually and naturally be weeded out through history.

And the act of realizing the **‘arbitrariness’** of one’s own belief, and yet ‘choosing’ a path that works—that is the very beginning of true intellectual freedom.
