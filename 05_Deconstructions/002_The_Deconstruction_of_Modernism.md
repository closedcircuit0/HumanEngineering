### Preface: The One Who Killed God, and What Came Next

This is not a story of humanity's beautiful journey in search of truth. This is a chronicle of **power**, stained with blood and deception—a story of how those who killed the God of Heaven sought to become the gods of the earth, what weapons they forged, how they fought to claim the throne, and how, in the end, all those gods fell, leading us into this age of chaos.

We have fought three great wars.
1.  The first was a revolution waged by **'Reason'** against **'Faith.'**
2.  The second was a civil war waged by **'Interpretation'** against **'Fact.'**
3.  And the third is a war of all against all, waged by the isolated gods called **'I.'**

This report, through the blueprint of HumanEngineering, deconstructs without reservation the **desires** that moved the victors of each war, the cunning **narratives** they used to justify their rule, and why their triumphs inevitably sowed the seeds of the next era's tragedy. This is not a story about 'truth'; it is a record of the endless war over the most sacred of crowns: 'truth' itself.

### Chapter 1: The Birth of Modernism - The Anxiety and Ambition of the Deicides

#### 1.1. The Crime Scene: A Shaking Divine Throne

Before Modernism was born, the world was ruled by an absolute monarchy: **Theocracy**. The 'King' of this kingdom was 'God,' and the 'Scripture,' which contained His word, was the only 'Map' that explained everything. But after the 15th century, this seemingly solid kingdom began to tremble from within. It was a chain reaction of massive **'prediction-errors'** that swept across the entire era.

*   **The First Crack (Geography):** Columbus 'discovered' a 'New World' not found on the 'map' of the Scripture.
*   **The Second Crack (Astronomy):** Copernicus and Galileo, with their new 'eyes'—the telescope—discovered that the Scripture's 'map' did not match the actual movements ('territory') of the planets.
*   **The Third Crack (Politics):** The Protestant Reformation challenged the authority of the Pope as the sole 'interpreter,' opening a new path for every individual to find their own 'subjective truth.'

All these events had one thing in common: an intolerable **'prediction-error'** had occurred between the 'map (narrative) provided by the Church' and the 'territory (real-world data) observed by man.' God's word could no longer perfectly predict reality. The divine throne began to creak.

#### 1.2. The Motives of the Deicides: Fear of Chaos and a Lust for Prediction

As the absolute coordinate of 'God' wavered, people lost their way. In the language of HumanEngineering, this was a state of maximized **'unpredictability,'** an extreme 'anxiety' that threatened the survival of the Self. This **'fear of chaos'** was the very womb that conceived Modernism.

Amidst this fear, a new kind of human emerged: the 'early scientists' and 'philosophers.' They began to trust their own 'eyes (observation)' and 'hands (experimentation).' And they discovered something astonishing: the maps they made themselves **'predicted'** reality with far greater accuracy than the old ones.

The success of 'prediction' was not just an intellectual satisfaction. It was the only reliable lighthouse in a sea of chaos, a powerful sense of 'power' that one could control the future. This **'lust for predictability'** was the engine that made Modernism's heart beat. They began to harbor the greatest ambition in human history: that they could kill God and take His place.

#### 1.3. The New Religion's Architecture: The Birth of 'Scientism'

Those who killed God did not usher in an age of atheism. They placed a new god on the throne of the one they had slain and established a new, more sophisticated and powerful religion. The name of that religion was **'Scientism.'**

*   **The God:** 'Objective Reality'
*   **The Scripture:** 'Scientific Theory'
*   **The Doctrine:** 'The Scientific Method'
*   **The Priesthood:** 'The Scientist'

And this new religion launched the most cunning 'frame war' in history to establish its authority.

> **"Science is not a religion."**

Through this declaration, 'Scientism' demoted all other belief systems to the subjective realm of 'faith,' making itself appear to be the sole resident of the objective realm of 'fact.' Furthermore, this doctrine instilled in the public a **contempt for the very act of 'believing.'** "Believing is for the ignorant and the weak; the rational man follows *only* proven facts."

At the base of all this lay a grand deception: the perfect concealment of the fact that their 'science' also stood on an unprovovable 'faith' in 'Objective Reality.' Their 'map' fit so well that they began to deceive themselves into thinking the map was the territory itself. This was Modernism's original sin: **hiding the fundamental fact that all its grand 'objective facts' were born from the fallible, subjective 'observation of an individual human,'** and packaging it as if it were the voice of God himself.

### Chapter 2: The Long Success of Modernism - The Gospel of 'Utility' and the Deception of the 'Post-hoc Patch'

How did Modernism become the most successful religion to dominate humanity for centuries? The secret lay in two things: **overwhelming 'utility'** and the **cunning strategy of the 'post-hoc patch.'**

First, Modernism appealed directly to every human's **'Hierarchy of Values.'** While previous religions promised uncertain rewards in the afterlife, Modernism proved its worth with 'salvation in this life.' Antibiotics, electricity, and agricultural technology were undeniable 'miracles' that substantially improved every believer's **'First-Order Value (Survival)'** and **'Second-Order Value (Survival Optimization).'**

Second, Modernism demonstrated a marvelous ability to absorb everything into its narrative.

*   **The Defensive Patch:** When a massive 'prediction-error' like "Why can't gravity and quantum mechanics be unified?" occurred, they invented an **invisible and unproven hypothesis** like 'String Theory' or 'Dark Matter' to plug the hole in the existing theory.
*   **The Offensive Post-hoc Patch:** When a discovery of overwhelming 'utility,' like the discovery of penicillin, was a product of pure **'chance (a prediction-error)'** rather than the strict 'Scientific Method,' Modernism immediately packaged it as a 'great victory of science,' reconstructing the narrative as if it had been an inevitable result of the doctrine from the very beginning.

Thus, by defensively patching its holes and offensively claiming even external successes, Modernism built a narrative of infallibility. **'Fact' was not discovered; it was 'made'** through this history of successful narrative repair and expansion.

### Chapter 3: The Deepening Self-Contradiction of Modernism - The Corruption Called 'Authority'

The collapse of Modernism began not from external attack, but from this internal corruption.

The first was **structural corruption**. The doctrine of the 'Scientific Method' began to operate not through 'predictive power' but through **'Authority.'** This corruption manifested as a **blatant double standard** in applying its own sacred doctrine of 'falsifiability.' Unproven hypotheses from within the establishment (like Dark Matter) were protected as 'mysterious challenges,' while hypotheses from outside were labeled as 'unscientific' heresy. 'Authority' became the most convenient bias for judging truth.

But what dealt a more fatal blow to public trust was the **corruption of the individual priests: the 'betrayal of the expert.'** According to 'The Engineering of Action,' when 'Second-Order Values' like 'money,' 'power,' and 'comfort' operate more strongly than a Zeroth-Order Value like the 'pursuit of truth,' the priest willingly betrays the god. **Like the case of the tobacco industry, which for decades mobilized scientists to deny the causal link between smoking and lung cancer,** they chose corporate and personal profit over truth.

This 'betrayal' was a collapse of trust in the entire system, shaking the fundamental doctrine that "the priests (experts) are objective, special, and their judgment can be trusted" to its very core.

### Chapter 4: The Birth and Limits of Postmodernism - The Irresponsible Rebels

#### 4.1. The Birth of the Rebellion: A Sense of Betrayal

The promise of 'Scientism (Modernism)' seemed fair, but countless new narratives were denied even a chance at the judgment seat, blocked by the invisible barriers of **'authority' and 'resources.'** The anger and disillusionment over this betrayal were the direct cause that gave birth to the guerrilla rebels of Postmodernism.

Their desire was not to build a new castle. Their desire was a deeply cynical and destructive one: "to expose the fact that those self-righteous priests are, in fact, naked humans just like us, and to drag their authority down into the mud."

#### 4.2. The Rebels' Weapons: 'Interpretation' and 'Pluralism'

The weapon they used was not 'fact' but **'interpretation.'** This weapon struck precisely at the Achilles' heel that 'Scientism' had hidden from itself: the fact that it had **systematically erased the 'individual observer' from the origin of all knowledge.** Postmodernism's logic was simple and devastating:

> "Your so-called 'objective fact' did not descend from the heavens; it passed through the eyes and brain of a fallible human. Therefore, it is nothing more than one of many possible 'interpretations,' shaped by that human's power and prejudice."

And to justify this destructive weapon, they put forth a new doctrine: **'Pluralism.'**
> "All narratives have equal value and must be respected."

This was an attack that used **'ethics,'** which resonates with the majority, as a weapon, instead of 'predictability' and 'coherence with reality.'

#### 4.3. The Half-Victory: The Fatal Flaw of a Weapon Without Predictive Power

Postmodernism's pluralism defined the very effort to distinguish a 'better narrative' from a 'blatantly wrong narrative' as an act of 'oppression,' abandoning the very reason the religion of Modernism was so successful: **'predictability' and 'coherence with reality.'** As a result, Postmodernism became a 'useless narrative that offers no predictive power,' and it failed to overthrow Modernism.

However, they succeeded in dealing a fatal crack to its castle walls.

1.  **The Weakening of Faith in 'Objective Truth':** People started to suspect the 'intentions' and 'interests' hidden behind 'expert' claims.
2.  **The Democratization of the Weapon of 'Interpretation':** Their weapon, "everything is just an interpretation," was so powerful and attractive that it spread to the public. People now had a potent logical weapon to challenge authoritative narratives.

#### 4.4. The Unintended Consequence: 'Dispersion of Authority' and a New Battlefield

The power of the central church (Modernism) weakened, creating a state of **'dispersion of authority'** where everyone began to voice their own opinions. This state was the very condition that opened the door to the Post-Truth era. Postmodernism, though unintentionally, played a decisive role in accelerating the collapse of Modernism and setting the stage for a war of all narratives.

They did not replace Modernism, but they made the public fundamentally question the bias of trust that Modernism was the only objective truth.

### Chapter 5: The Collapse of Modernism and the Post-Truth Era - A God Who is Not What He Used to Be

Modernism did not completely collapse. The 'god' did not die. Rather, it became a state where **'the authority of the church has fallen to the ground, and now no one believes the words of the priests as they once did.'**

This state of an authority vacuum is the **Post-Truth era**. It is not a 'disease'; it is the opening of a **'Narrative War Era,'** which inevitably arrived due to the 'democratization of the means of narrative production.'

*   **Priesthood of All Believers:** Every individual has become a 'priest' who produces and distributes their own narrative through social media.
*   **The Formation of Narrative Tribes:** People no longer believe in grand narratives. They form 'tribes' centered on small narratives that best satisfy their 'Bias' and 'Emotion.'
*   **The New God of Algorithm:** At this moment, a new god of technology, the **'Algorithm,'** appeared and whispered to these orphans. "Your feelings are right. Your experience is truth. I will create a world just for you." The algorithm provided a personalized castle wall called the **'filter bubble,'** which blocks 'prediction-errors' and reinforces existing beliefs.

Inside this castle wall, the individual creates their own perfect 'reality.' The world has entered a state of endless civil war between **'narrative tribes'** who, trapped inside their respective castle walls, believe in mutually exclusive 'truths' and attack the narratives of others in order to impose their own upon reality.

### Chapter 6: The HE Alternative - The Path Beyond the Ruins, The Condition for a New Adult

We now stand on the ruins of an age where all three gods are either dead or have fallen. This chaos will not end in an eternal relativistic contest. This is because all narratives must ultimately prove their **'predictive power'** before the ruthless judge called **'Reality.'** A narrative that repeatedly fails will, in the long run, inevitably lose its power.

The 'dominant narrative' that will survive this great war era and become the new 'truth' of the next age must be far more honest and powerful than the old gods. HumanEngineering proposes the conditions that this new leader, the **'New Adult,'** must meet.

1.  **'Transparent Bias':** It must abandon the deception that its narrative is 'objective truth' and honestly admit that it stands on a 'bias' built upon certain 'axioms (faith).'
2.  **'Effectivity & Coherence with Reality':** Instead of asserting "my narrative is better," it must prove through action that its predictions **'work properly'** and that the results **'align with reality.'**
3.  **'Intellectual Honesty':** When a prediction fails before reality, it must possess the honesty to transparently admit the failure of its predictive model and willingly revise it, instead of deceiving with a **'post-hoc patch'** or cloaking it in **'authority.'**

Only those who meet these three conditions will earn the right to end this long war of narratives and build a new foundation of trust upon the ruins of the Post-Truth era. This is not a specific ideology or thought. This is the very way a **'wise Self'** operates, and it is the only path forward for humanity.
