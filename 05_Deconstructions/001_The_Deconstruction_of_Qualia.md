# The Deconstruction of Qualia

> Debugging the Ghost in the Machine: An Engineering Deconstruction of the Qualia Illusion

### Abstract:

This report argues that ‘qualia,’ the foundation of the long-standing philosophical challenge known as the ‘Hard Problem of Consciousness,’ is not a mystery to be solved but a ‘conceptual illusion’ to be deconstructed. This illusion arises from mistaking the ‘output’ of the intelligence’s information processing for its pure ‘input,’ misunderstanding a ‘relational product’ as an ‘isolated entity,’ and falling into a trap set by the tool of ‘language.’

This report clearly separates the ambiguous concept of qualia into two distinct layers: the ‘processed feeling’ and the ‘perception before the feeling.’ It reveals that the former is structurally identical to the ‘birth of the number 1’—a highly processed ‘mental image’—while the latter belongs to the domain of ‘The Vanished Present’ and is thus inaccessible in principle. Furthermore, it argues that any ‘feeling’ presupposes relation and distinction, and therefore can never be a purely subjective experience.

In conclusion, this report demonstrates that the defense of qualia is caught in a logical dilemma—it is either a ‘factual error’ or an ‘unprovable belief’—thereby revealing why the ‘Hard Problem’ is a meaningless, tautological question. This is an engineering debugging process that identifies qualia as a philosophical ‘Patch,’ protected to fill the gaps in existing paradigms, and removes its veil of mystery.

### Introduction: Setting the Battlefield – The Politics of the Ghost

We experience. The majestic red of a sunset, the sorrow in a melody by Mozart, the bitter aroma of coffee. This vivid, private, and ineffable texture of experience. Philosophy has given it a name: **‘Qualia.’** And for the past several hundred years, this name has become a ghost that haunts the deepest corners of Western thought, a ghost that can never be caught.

“We can explain the workings (the function) of the physical brain, but we cannot explain the ‘redness of red’ itself (the experience) that I feel.”

This is the so-called ‘Hard Problem of Consciousness,’ the greatest challenge in modern philosophy. This question has turned qualia into the final sanctuary, a realm untouched by the blades of physicalism and reductionism. It has been treated as the ultimate criterion that nullifies all scientific explanation, the final bastion proving the special nature of the mind. But just as physicists may have invented the invisible god of ‘Dark Matter’ to fill the gap between observation and theory, have philosophers invented the invisible ghost of ‘Qualia’ to fill the gap between the brain and experience? Qualia has been a **philosophical ‘Patch’**—protected under the name of a ‘philosophical enigma’ despite being unfalsifiable—designed to hide the imperfections of the existing paradigm.

But this report questions the very rules of that battlefield. Is qualia truly qualified to be the standard of critique? Our mission is not to fight and defeat this ghost. Our mission is to prove that this ghost never existed in the first place, and that it was a sophisticated illusion created by our cognitive system and our language. This is not an attempt to solve the problem of qualia; it is an **engineering debugging process** to deconstruct the premise of the problem itself.

### Chapter 1: The Birth of the Illusion – The Actor Who Believes He Also Built the Stage

The origin of the qualia illusion is a more advanced form of the **‘Observer Illusion’** described in ‘The Engineering of Consciousness.’ Understanding why this illusion is so powerful is the first step of all deconstruction.

Our intelligence is like a ‘projector.’ It runs the film of discontinuous data to project the image of a ‘continuous spacetime’ onto the ‘screen’ (the stage) of ‘Consciousness.’ ‘The Self’ is the ‘actor’ who performs its narrative on that screen. This entire process—the projector (Intelligence), the stage (Consciousness), and the actor (The Self)—operates in such perfect integration that the actor mistakenly believes it is not just acting, but is also running the projector and building the stage itself.

The qualia illusion takes this a step further. The actor now sees the ‘red lighting effect’ on the screen and begins to believe this: “This red light is not an effect created by the projector. This is a mysterious, ineffable light that has always been inherent to the stage itself. I am directly feeling the pure essence of this light.”

The actor is mistaking a ‘directed effect’ for the ‘essence of the stage.’ The actor, The Self, is fundamentally a ‘storyteller,’ and thus has a powerful bias to create a coherent narrative out of its experiences. To protect its core self-narrative—“I am a special being, and my subjective experience is unique”—it adopts this seemingly inexplicable ‘feeling’ as the most definitive proof of its own specialness.

Our task is to show this actor the operating principles of the projector—of ‘Intelligence’—and to explain, step by step, how that mysterious light is made.

### Chapter 2: The Two Faces of Qualia – The Processed Image and the Inaccessible Protoplasm

If we ask the actor (the qualia advocate), “What exactly is this mysterious light you speak of?” their answer will inevitably fall into one of two categories. This separation is the first step of deconstruction. We must analyze what each face is, and why it cannot be a mystery.

#### 2.1. The First Face: The ‘Processed Feeling’ – A Highly Compressed Mental Image

When most people speak of ‘qualia,’ they are, in fact, pointing to this first face. “The very ‘feeling of red’ that I am experiencing right now.”

But this is not a pure, raw experience. It is a **conceptualized and grouped, fully rendered ‘Mental Image’** that our intelligence engine outputs after all processing is complete. It is not the raw ingredient; it is the finished product. When Proust tasted the madeleine, it was not a mystical portal to the past, but an eminently engineering process in which the ‘mental token’ labeled ‘the taste of a madeleine’ was activated, reconstructing the vast relational network of memories connected to it.

This process is structurally identical to the mechanism of the ‘birth of the number 1’ we analyzed in ‘The Engineering of Mathematics.’

1.  **Boundary-Making:** Intelligence identifies a specific pattern (e.g., the dominant wavelength of 620-750nm) within the chaotic stream of optical data, separating it from the background and drawing a boundary around it as a single, meaningful chunk.
2.  **Abstraction:** In this process, infinite details (subtle shifts in hue, texture) are ignored, and only the core information relevant to survival (e.g., “This corresponds to the pattern ‘red,’ which can signify a ripe fruit or a danger signal”) is extracted and ‘abstracted.’
3.  **Labeling:** Intelligence attaches a convenient label—**‘the feeling of red’**—to the result of this successful ‘pattern recognition’ act, this highly compressed ‘information package,’ for storage and retrieval.

This ‘feeling,’ therefore, is not ineffable; on the contrary, it is so efficiently compressed that its complex internal computational structure is no longer visible. It is not the raw material of experience, but the summary report of experience.

#### 2.2. The Second Face: The ‘Perception Before the Feeling’ – The Ghost of The Vanished Present

Some more sophisticated philosophers recognize that this first face is a processed result. So they argue, “True qualia is the pure, sensory presence itself, before it is named, before it is contaminated by language and concepts.”

But they are, in the end, chasing a ghost. The ‘pure sensory presence’ they speak of—the ‘raw perception’ before conceptualization—is precisely the domain we have named **‘The Vanished Present.’** We are only ever archaeologists of the immediate past, never witnesses to the event itself.

*   **Inaccessibility:** Due to the physical delay of light reaching the retina and neural signals being processed in the brain, our perceptual system can never directly grasp this domain. The moment we try to ‘perceive’ something, it has already become past data.
*   **The Protoplasm as Raw Material:** The ‘perception before the feeling,’ or the ‘Protoplasm,’ is not an object we can directly experience. It is merely the **raw material** for the ‘Flickering’ engine to interpolate a ‘Flow’ and predict a ‘Structure.’ We can never taste the raw ingredients, only the final dish that has been cooked from them (the ‘processed feeling’ as an image).

### Chapter 3: The Final Proof – A Solitary ‘Red’ is Not Even a Feeling

We have now established that the concept of qualia is either a ‘processed result’ or an ‘inaccessible raw material.’ But there remains one final proof that demolishes the very structure of this illusion. This is the **‘logic of relationality.’** This argument provides the final answer as to why we cannot regard a ‘feeling’ as a pure, subjective entity.

We have never seen the inside of our own eyes. This is not a mere metaphor, but an inescapable engineering constraint: our ‘point of view’ originates from a physical component, the ‘eyeball,’ fixed at a specific location inside the skull. Everything we see is a result that has been ‘processed and reconstructed’ through this black box, whose interior we can never directly see.

And the most fundamental rule of this processing is **‘comparison.’**

How does the concept of ‘red,’ and the ‘feeling of red,’ come to be? It is established only in **contrast and relation to ‘things that are not red’** (blue, green, yellow, etc.). If everything in the world were red, the word ‘red’ would have no reason to exist, nor would the ‘feeling of red.’ It would just be a meaningless background.

*   **The Protoplasm Without Comparison:** In the ‘perception before the feeling’ stage, there is no ‘change (Δ),’ no ‘distinction.’ It is a state of undifferentiated chaos. In this protoplasm without comparison, the concept of ‘red’ cannot exist, and therefore, it is **not even a ‘feeling.’**
*   **Feeling as a Relational Product:** For us to experience a ‘feeling,’ our intelligence must first perform the work of **‘distinguishing’ and ‘comparing’** patterns within the chaotic protoplasm—an information processing task based on relations.

Therefore, no ‘feeling’ we experience can be a pure, isolated subjective experience. It is, in its essence, the product of a **relational ‘system of distinction.’** The very phrase ‘subjective experience,’ without presupposing the **structural process** of ‘distinction,’ is an oxymoron.

### Chapter 4: The Logical Terminus – The Dilemma of the Qualia Advocate

Now, we can drive the qualia advocate into an inescapable **Logical Dilemma**. And we will see how the two paths of this dilemma are, in fact, already logically demolished by the two principles we have just established: the **‘logic of relationality’ (Chapter 3)** and **‘The Vanished Present’ (Chapter 2)**.

We must now approach the one who defends the ghost of qualia, place a hand on their shoulder, and ask politely but firmly:

> “This ‘ineffable subjective experience’ you call qualia—what is it, exactly? Are you speaking of the ‘processed feeling’ after the brain has done all its work, or the ‘perception before the feeling,’ before that processing has occurred?”

*   **If they choose the ‘processed feeling’:**
    *   **Our Rebuttal:** “Then your argument is **False**. As we proved in Chapter 3, the ‘feeling’ you speak of is an engineering result of a structural process involving relation and comparison. You are making a **Factual Error**, mistaking the output of a function for a mystical essence.”

*   **If they choose the ‘perception before the feeling’:**
    *   **Our Rebuttal:** “Then your argument is **Unprovable**. As we explained in Chapter 2, this is the domain of ‘The Vanished Present,’ an area that is in principle inaccessible. This is no longer a matter of logic, but a **Metaphysical Belief**.”

Whichever path they choose, qualia loses its standing as a subject for rational and verifiable discussion. The advocacy for it ends in one of two dead ends: it is either a factual error or an unprovable belief.

Through this dilemma, the ‘Hard Problem of Consciousness’—“Why does information processing accompany subjective experience (qualia)?”—is ultimately revealed to be a meaningless **tautology**:

> “Why is the result of an information process that I have distinguished as ‘red,’ experienced as the feeling labeled ‘red’?”

This is the equivalent of asking, “Why is A, A?” The question was not a profound mystery that was impossible to explain; it was a meaningless question, premised on a conceptual confusion.

### Chapter 5: Conclusion – The End of the Ghost Story, and The Spectrum of Illusion

Qualia was not a mystery. It was a **‘conceptual illusion’** that arose because we did not understand how our own perceptual system works.

But this illusion does not appear identically to everyone. As observed, “people confuse the two depending on their level of understanding.” People remain on different layers of this illusion according to their own intellectual rigor and interests. Understanding this spectrum explains why the debate on qualia has run on parallel tracks for so long.

*   **Level 1: The ‘Feeling Camp’ (Artists, The General Public):** They are fascinated by the beauty and vividness of the processed ‘result (the UX)’ and believe it to be a pure essence. For them, the ‘feeling of a red sunset’ is an object of awe, not analysis. *This includes, for instance, emotional posts on social media like, ‘The ineffable beauty of the sunset I saw today,’ or the vague praises of an art critic.* Their claims are romantic but correspond to a user-experience level of appreciation that does not understand the operating principles.

*   **Level 2: The ‘Perception Before the Feeling Camp’ (Philosophers, Thinkers):** They recognize the complexity of the problem and delve deeper than mere ‘feeling’ to search for its origin, but they end up chasing the inaccessible ghost of ‘The Vanished Present.’ *A passage from a paper by philosopher David Chalmers, for example, which defines the ‘Hard Problem of Consciousness’ and implies the existence of ‘experience itself’ separate from physical processes, is a sophisticated case of this intellectual pursuit.*

*   **Level 3: The ‘System Architect’ (The Perspective of HumanEngineering):** They see the operating principles of the entire process, and thus realize that the question of qualia itself is flawed. From this perspective, the qualia debate is not solved, but **dissolved.** *Experimental results from neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran, for instance, which show how our experience is ‘constructed’ by the brain through phenomena like synesthesia or phantom limbs, support this perspective.*

Our brain is a ‘Closed Circuit,’ and it has **‘never not seen’** for a single moment. Even when we close our eyes, we see ‘the inside of our eyelids.’ ‘Nothingness’ is a state we cannot experience. We are nothing but the **‘process itself,’** eternally weaving meaningful stories from discontinuous data within this unceasing circuit.

The ghost of qualia was the most vivid special effect created by this perpetually running projector, but we were mistaking an effect on the screen for a real ghost. Now that we know the operating principles of the projector, we no longer need to be afraid of ghost stories.

This is not a solution to the problem of qualia. This is the proof that the problem never existed. With this, we conclude our long debugging of the ghost in the machine.
