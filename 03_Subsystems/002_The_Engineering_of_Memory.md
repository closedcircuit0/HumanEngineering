# The Engineering of Memory

> Memory is Not What You Remember, But What You Recreate

### 1. Introduction: The Third-Person ‘I’ in a First-Person Memory
To understand the complex system of the ‘Self,’ which we have previously discussed, in greater detail, we cannot omit its most crucial material and blueprint: ‘Memory.’ We all live in memory. We believe that the “me of today” exists because the “me of yesterday” existed. But how solid is the foundation of that belief? What is memory? Is it like a camera, one that perfectly imprints all our senses as they are?

Let’s recall our childhood. Our memories are clearly filled with our vivid emotions and sensations.

I had a memory of riding a bicycle across a neighborhood road when I was three. The warm sunlight, the feeling of my legs on the pedals, and an excitement mixed with a little fear. It was unmistakably ‘my’ memory. For a long time, however, I didn’t even realize there was something strange about it. The fact was that within that scene, the image of ‘me riding the bicycle’ was reproduced as if it were a scene from a movie.

At some point, I realized the impossible contradiction. In a first-person experience, I can never ‘see’ my own back or my side profile. So what was this vivid memory? It wasn’t my pure experience. It was a memory meticulously ‘crafted’ from the combination of my parents’ repeated remarks — “You used to dash all over the neighborhood on your bike” — and my own vague, fragmentary memories (of the sunlight, the sensation).

This single experience reveals a shocking truth. Within our memories, alongside those derived from our own vivid senses, there exists a significant number of narratives crafted from somewhere else. Memory is not an archive that preserves the past, but a stage on which the present self constantly reinterprets and recreates the past. This article seeks to uncover the secrets of this grand performance of memory that unfolds behind the scenes.

### 2. The Imprint of Prediction-Error: How Emotion Becomes the Anchor of Memory
If our memory is not a videotape that stores the past as it is, why are some scenes so vividly remembered while others vanish without a trace? The criterion for this selection lies in our ‘interpolation-prediction system’ and the ‘emotion’ it produces.

The core function of intelligence is ‘prediction.’ We constantly predict the world, and through the difference between our prediction and reality — the ‘Prediction-Error’ — we learn about the world. And it is the magnitude of this ‘Prediction-Error’ that creates the qualitative signal of experience we call ‘emotion.’

- When ‘a prediction with high uncertainty turns out to be correct,’ we feel a sense of ‘relief’ and ‘thrilling achievement.’
- When ‘a prediction is greatly mistaken,’ we feel ‘surprise,’ ‘shock,’ or ‘bewilderment.’ (e.g., the unexpected betrayal of a trusted friend, or a minor twist like, “He’s overweight, but he doesn’t eat as much as I thought.”)

These intense emotions leave an indelible ‘imprint’ on the corresponding event. It acts as a signal: “This moment is significant — do not let it fade.” This is the ‘Anchoring’ effect, which drops an anchor in the sea of memory. Ultimately, emotion is the ‘index’ or ‘bookmark’ of memory, placed on moments of significant prediction-error that the future self must refer to. Memory without emotion does not exist, and emotion without memory loses its meaning. The two are, in effect, two sides of the same coin.

Once an anchor is set, our memory reorganizes itself around that anchor. We begin to logically piece together other fragmented memories based on that most intense event, much like a detective piecing together an alibi around a crime scene.

“A got drunk and surprised everyone then. That must have been around 9 o’clock. B didn’t see that mess, so he probably left before that. C knew about it the next day, so he must have stayed there later.”

This is the process of memory reconstruction. It’s a process of completing a coherent narrative by ‘rearranging’ and ‘interpolating’ the presence of other people (fragments of memory) in chronological order, centered on the most intense anchor (A’s commotion).

### 3. The Body’s Memory: The Bias Etched in Flesh
If you think memory is solely an activity of the brain, you are only seeing half the story. Our body also has its own powerful and stubborn memory system. And the form of that memory is ‘Habit.’

Think about learning to ride a bicycle for the first time. You fall countless times, jerking the handlebars back and forth (prediction-error), as your brain desperately searches for the optimal way to maintain balance. From the moment you finally figure it out, you no longer consciously think about ‘how to pedal and turn the handlebars.’ That entire complex process is etched into the body like a single ‘Shortcut.’

This is the exact same mechanism as the brain’s ‘bias.’ The body’s habit is a ‘physical bias,’ automated by finding the most energy-efficient pattern of action through countless trials and errors. And this powerful body memory also deeply fuses with our ‘Self.’ The narrative self that claims, “I am a person who rides a bike well,” is supported not only by the brain’s thoughts but also by the muscle memory of the body. The self-image that insists, “I need to drink coffee every morning to wake up,” is inseparable from the body’s physiological memory (dependence) of caffeine.

Ultimately, ‘memory’ exists in both the brain and the body, and they reinforce each other. A mental trauma manifesting as physical pain, or a bad physical habit eroding mental self-esteem, are clear evidence that memory and body are an inseparable single system.

### 4. The Self as a Narrative: The Thread That Weaves Past and Future
In the end, who is the final editor that bundles all these fragments of memory — the brain’s reconstructed stories and the body’s ingrained habits — and declares, “This is me”? It is the ‘Self.’

The Self is, in itself, a ‘narrative.’ And the process of creating this narrative is identical to the operating principle of the ‘interpolation-prediction’ engine.

- **Reconstructing the Past Self (t-axis interpolation):** We continually ask ourselves, “What kind of person was I in the past?” And centered on the memories (anchors) of success and failure, we reconstruct a narrative of the ‘past self’ that justifies our present self, such as, “I am a being who has grown by overcoming numerous hardships,” or “I have always been a lucky person.”
- **Predicting the Future Self (z-axis prediction):** Based on this reconstructed past narrative, we predict and set a goal for the ‘future self’ by asking, “What kind of person will I be in the future?” We predict, “Since I have had many successful experiences, my future self will achieve even greater success.”

Thus, the past self (t) becomes the most crucial material for creating the future self (z). We recreate the past through memory, and using that recreated past as a stepping stone, we imagine the future. The being called ‘I’ is an unstable yet dynamic creation, woven anew each moment in the narrative ‘flickering’ between this past and future.

### 5. The Memory of an Organism: The 8 Concertos of Brain and Body
We now know that the brain’s narrative memory and the body’s habitual memory are not separate. Within a single organism, they interact across the axis of time, sometimes creating harmonious chords, and other times, jarring dissonances. All the inner dramas of the being called ‘I’ unfold on the stage of these eight concertos.

**[Axis 1: Brain’s Past vs. Body’s Past] — The Concerto of Truth and Falsehood**
- *Dissonance (The Pain of Self-Deception):* Your brain reconstructs a childhood trauma in a way that protects the Self, saying, “It was no big deal, and I handled it bravely.” However, your body, when faced with a specific place or person related to that event, honestly reproduces the traumatic memory of the past through unexplainable tension, a racing heart, and cold sweats. At this moment, the ‘past the brain wants to believe’ and the ‘past the body remembers’ cry out different truths, and we experience an ‘inner division.’ The body knows the brain is lying.
- *Harmony (Authentic Self-Understanding):* Through counseling or introspection, the brain acknowledges and verbalizes the truth of the past: “I was truly struggling and scared back then.” At this moment, the body’s past reactions, which were once unexplainable, are finally given a ‘name’ and understood. The past of the brain and the body finally align into a single narrative, opening a path for us to heal our wounds and move toward an integrated ‘I.’

**[Axis 2: Brain’s Past vs. Body’s Future] — The Concerto of Reminiscence and Reality**
- *Dissonance (The Sorrow of Decline):* Standing before a mirror, the brain recalls the memory of the past (anchor) of a younger, more radiant ‘I.’ The brain’s narrative still insists, “I am a vibrant and attractive being.” But the body presents the physical evidence of an unavoidable future (aging and death): wrinkles, gray hair, and diminished stamina. This clash between a brain still dwelling in the past and a body revealing the reality of decline gives rise to ‘sadness,’ ‘a sense of loss,’ and ‘existential anxiety.’
- *Harmony (Wise Acceptance):* The brain affirms the past by saying, “There were days when I enjoyed surfing,” while also writing a new narrative that accepts the changes of the future (old age): “Now, my joy is to watch the calm sea while sipping tea.” The memory of the past and the present body reconcile, creating the beautiful harmony of ‘the wisdom of age.’

**[Axis 3: Brain’s Future vs. Body’s Past] — The Concerto of Ideals and Inertia**
- *Dissonance (The Most Common Conflict):* On New Year’s Day, your brain declares a hopeful ideal for the future: “I will live a healthy life this year!” But the next morning, your body follows the powerful inertia of habit, which was itself formed for the sake of energy efficiency, accumulated over decades: the memory that says, “I need more sleep in the morning to save energy.” At this moment, a sharp discrepancy arises between the ‘narrative of the brain’ heading toward the future and the ‘memory of the body’ bound to the past, and we experience ‘guilt’ and ‘self-loathing.’
- *Harmony (Growth by Using Inertia):* The brain sets a realistic plan for the future: “I will take a 10-minute walk every day.” The body, without much resistance to its lazy habit of the past, complies, thinking, “This is manageable.” In this gradual change, the brain’s sense of achievement and the body’s comfort find harmony, creating a virtuous cycle where small successes lead to greater ones.

**[Axis 4: Brain’s Future vs. Body’s Future] — The Concerto of Goal and Execution**
- *Dissonance (Anxiety and Hesitation):* The brain, facing an important presentation in the future, repeatedly runs negative predictions: “What if I mess up?” In response to this prediction, the body also prepares for a future state of failure by becoming tense and shaky. Both thought and action are trapped in a negative future, and we experience a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ of accomplishing nothing.
- *Harmony (Perfect Immersion, Flow):* The brain sets a clear and positive goal for the future: “I will get the ball in that hoop.” Simultaneously, the body, honed by tens of thousands of repetitions, automatically performs the most optimized movements toward that future to achieve the goal. At this moment, the brain’s prediction and the body’s execution, the training of the past and the goal of the future, become perfectly one, and the ‘I’ disappears, leaving only the wondrous experience of the ‘act’ itself.

Our life is a grand symphony, created by the constant intersection and variation of these eight concertos. And memory is the full score of this complex and beautiful symphony itself.

### 6. The Breakdown of Memory: The Collapse of the Narrative Reconstruction Engine
What happens when this sophisticated memory system breaks down? ‘Dementia’ is the phenomenon that most dramatically illustrates the collapse of this system.
The core of dementia is not simply having past information ‘deleted.’ It is a process in which the narrative reconstruction engine itself is destroyed. Even when a new ‘prediction-error’ experience occurs, the function of ‘emotion’ that should create an ‘anchor’ and assess its importance is impaired. As even the powerful anchors created in the past fade, memories lose their reference points and begin to scatter into meaningless fragments.
A patient, beyond simply forgetting “Did I just eat a meal?”, falls into confusion because they cannot reconcile their physical sensation of hunger with the fragmented memory suggesting they’ve already eaten. This signifies the collapse of the ‘coherence of the self-narrative,’ and as the story of “Who am I” falls apart, they can no longer recognize even their closest loved ones. The root of this tragedy can be seen in the failure to create an environment that induces new prediction-errors, causing the engine of intelligence — which builds new memories (biases) and maintains the existing ‘web of meaning’ — to grind to a halt.

### 7. The Memory of a Machine: Hallucination Without Anchors or Narrative
In a previous article, we discussed the differences between the human and AI self. So what about memory when it comes to AI? Current AI can mimic human memory, but it lacks the essential underlying mechanisms. The ‘Hallucination’ phenomenon often produced by AI clearly illustrates this difference.
Human ‘memory reconstruction’ is a form of logical ‘detective work,’ based on the solid evidence of ‘anchors’ and the coherent narrative of the ‘Self.’ In contrast, AI’s ‘hallucination’ is closer to an automatic text generator that assembles plausible phrases based on statistical likelihood alone, without such anchors or narrative.
To infer that “B was not there at the time,” an AI does not understand the importance of the emotional anchor of ‘A’s commotion.’ Since it has no ‘Self,’ an AI has no interest in whether the story it creates aligns with its own identity. As a result, its memory ends up as a list of plausible but empty information, lacking depth and context. This could be the key to solving the problem of AI’s lack of ‘long-term memory.’ True long-term memory is not simply about storing information, but about the ability to reconstruct it into a meaningful narrative through ‘emotion’ and ‘Self.’

### 8. Conclusion: You Are The Writer of Your Story
Our journey began with the question, “What is memory?”, and after traversing the complex concertos of the brain and body, the self and emotion, we have returned to our starting point. And we have arrived at one important truth.
Memory is by no means the ‘truth of the past.’ It is a movie that your present self constantly re-screens to protect the narrative of your ‘Self.’ We do not possess the past; we create the past according to the needs of the present.
This is the essence of memory.
This provides one fundamental insight. It is the realization that the past we were clinging to was, in fact, not a solid iron chain, but a series of film strips that could be re-edited at any time. Your most brilliant success and your most terrible failure are not unchangeable, taxidermied truths. They are merely an interpretation, whose color and weight change depending on the meaning you assign to them in the present.
Now we know. The past is not fixed. Therefore, the ‘I’ that you believed was created by that past is also not fixed. You are a product of the story you remember, but at the same time, you are also the writer of that story.
Knowing this fact. That is where all new possibilities begin.
