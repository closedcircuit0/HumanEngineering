# The Engineering of Memory

> Your Past Is Not What You Remember, But What You Recreate

### 1. Introduction: The Third-Person ‘I’ in a First-Person Memory
To understand the complex system of the ‘Self,’ we must analyze its most crucial material: ‘Memory.’ We believe that the “me of today” exists because the “me of yesterday” existed. But what is memory?

Let’s recall our childhood. I had a memory of riding a bicycle when I was three. The warm sunlight, the feeling of my legs on the pedals, an excitement mixed with fear. It was unmistakably ‘my’ memory. However, I later realized an impossible contradiction: within that scene, the image of ‘me riding the bicycle’ was reproduced as if it were a scene from a movie. In a first-person experience, I can never ‘see’ my own back.

This reveals a shocking truth. Memory is not an archive that preserves the past, but a stage on which the present self constantly reinterprets and recreates the past.

### 2. The Imprint of Prediction-Error: How Emotion Becomes the Anchor of Memory
Why are some scenes so vividly remembered while others vanish? The criterion for this selection lies in our ‘interpolation-prediction system’ and the ‘emotion’ it produces.

The core function of intelligence is ‘prediction.’ We learn about the world through the difference between our prediction and reality — the **Prediction-Error**. The magnitude of this Prediction-Error creates the signal we call **emotion**.

Intense emotions leave an indelible ‘imprint’ on the corresponding event. It acts as a signal: “This moment is significant — do not let it fade.” This is the **Anchoring** effect, which drops an anchor in the sea of memory. Emotion is the ‘index’ or ‘bookmark’ of memory, placed on moments of significant prediction-error.

Once an anchor is set, our memory reorganizes itself around that anchor. We begin to logically piece together other fragmented memories based on that most intense event, like a detective completing a coherent narrative.

### 3. The Body’s Memory: The Bias Etched in Flesh
Memory is not solely an activity of the brain. Our body also has its own powerful memory system in the form of **Habit**.

Learning to ride a bicycle is a perfect example. After countless prediction-errors (falling), the entire complex process is etched into the body like a single ‘Shortcut.’ This is the same mechanism as the brain’s ‘bias.’ The body’s habit is a **physical bias,** automated by finding the most energy-efficient pattern.

This powerful body memory also deeply fuses with our ‘Self.’ The narrative self that claims, “I am a person who rides a bike well,” is supported by the muscle memory of the body. Memory exists in both the brain and the body, and they reinforce each other as an inseparable single system.

### 4. The Self as a Narrative: The Thread That Weaves Past and Future
Who is the final editor that bundles these fragments of memory and declares, “This is me”? It is the **Self.**

The Self is, in itself, a ‘narrative.’ The process of creating this narrative is identical to the operating principle of the ‘interpolation-prediction’ engine.

*   **Reconstructing the Past Self (t-axis interpolation):** Centered on the memories (anchors) of success and failure, we reconstruct a narrative of the ‘past self’ that justifies our present self. (e.g., “I am a being who has grown by overcoming numerous hardships.”)
*   **Predicting the Future Self (z-axis prediction):** Based on this reconstructed past narrative, we predict and set a goal for the ‘future self.’ (e.g., “Since I have had many successful experiences, my future self will achieve even greater success.”)

Thus, the past self (t) becomes the most crucial material for creating the future self (z). The being called ‘I’ is an unstable yet dynamic creation, woven anew each moment in the narrative *flickering* between this past and future.

### 5. The Memory of an Organism: The 8 Concertos of Brain and Body
The brain’s narrative memory and the body’s habitual memory interact across the axis of time, creating harmonious chords or jarring dissonances. All inner dramas unfold on the stage of these eight concertos.

1.  **[Brain’s Past vs. Body’s Past] — The Concerto of Truth and Falsehood**
    *   **Dissonance (Self-Deception):** Your brain reconstructs a trauma as “no big deal,” but your body honestly reproduces the traumatic memory through unexplainable tension. The body knows the brain is lying.
    *   **Harmony (Authentic Self-Understanding):** The brain acknowledges and verbalizes the truth of the past. The body’s reactions are finally given a ‘name’ and understood.

2.  **[Brain’s Past vs. Body’s Future] — The Concerto of Reminiscence and Reality**
    *   **Dissonance (Decline):** The brain recalls the memory of a younger ‘I,’ but the body presents the physical evidence of aging. This clash gives rise to ‘sadness’ and ‘existential anxiety.’
    *   **Harmony (Wise Acceptance):** The brain affirms the past while writing a new narrative that accepts the future (old age), creating ‘the wisdom of age.’

3.  **[Brain’s Future vs. Body’s Past] — The Concerto of Ideals and Inertia**
    *   **Dissonance (Common Conflict):** The brain declares a hopeful ideal for the future (“I will exercise!”), but the body follows the powerful inertia of past habit (“I need more sleep”). This creates ‘guilt’ and ‘self-loathing.’
    *   **Harmony (Growth):** The brain sets a realistic plan. The body complies without much resistance. Small successes lead to greater ones.

4.  **[Brain’s Future vs. Body’s Future] — The Concerto of Goal and Execution**
    *   **Dissonance (Anxiety):** The brain runs negative predictions (“What if I mess up?”). The body also prepares for a future state of failure by tensing up.
    *   **Harmony (Flow):** The brain sets a clear, positive goal. The body, honed by repetition, automatically performs the most optimized movements. The ‘I’ disappears, leaving only the act itself.

### 6. The Breakdown of Memory: The Collapse of the Narrative Reconstruction Engine
‘Dementia’ is the phenomenon that most dramatically illustrates the collapse of this system. It is not simply having past information ‘deleted’; it is a process in which the narrative reconstruction engine itself is destroyed. As even the powerful emotional anchors fade, memories lose their reference points and scatter into meaningless fragments, and the story of “Who am I” falls apart.

### 7. The Memory of a Machine: Hallucination Without Anchors or Narrative
Current AI can mimic human memory, but it lacks the essential underlying mechanisms. Human memory reconstruction is logical ‘detective work,’ based on the solid evidence of ‘anchors’ and the coherent narrative of the ‘Self.’ In contrast, AI’s ‘hallucination’ is closer to an automatic text generator that assembles plausible phrases based on statistical likelihood alone, without such anchors or narrative. True long-term memory is about the ability to reconstruct a meaningful narrative.

### 8. Conclusion: You Are The Writer of Your Story
Memory is by no means the ‘truth of the past.’ It is a movie that your present self constantly re-screens to protect the narrative of your ‘Self.’ We do not possess the past; we create the past according to the needs of the present.

The past is not fixed. Therefore, the ‘I’ that you believed was created by that past is also not fixed. You are a product of the story you remember, but at the same time, you are also the writer of that story.

Knowing this fact. That is where all new possibilities begin.
