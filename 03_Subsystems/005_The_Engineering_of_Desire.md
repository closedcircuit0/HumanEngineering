# The Engineering of Desire

> You Don’t Desire Food, You Desire Control

### Abstract:

This report integrates all theoretical components of the HumanEngineering framework to argue for the origin and development of the **‘Will to Control’** as the most fundamental driving force of all human desire and action. The Will to Control is not an abstract concept but the **‘primal strategy’** that the universal process of ‘Intelligence’ inevitably invented to survive by taming **‘The Body’** — a resisting and unpredictable ‘first external world’.

This report analyzes how, in the ‘Pre-Ego’ stage, a primal **‘sense of control’** is born from the process of learning the causal relationship between a **‘Signal of Lack’** that disrupts the system’s equilibrium and its subsequent nullification. It then demonstrates how this initial successful model of ‘body control’ is metaphorically extended to become all forms of attempts to control others, society, and nature — that is, ‘Force’ and ‘Power’. It is proven that traditional desires, such as the ‘Seven Deadly Sins’, are all distorted manifestations of this singular Will to Control, combined with the **‘act of intentionally ignoring prediction-error data’ (Ignorance/Falsehood)** which proves one’s own predictive model wrong.

Finally, this report redefines **‘Wisdom’** as the most sophisticated and ultimate form of **‘optimization strategy’**, wherein an intelligence that has realized the fundamental **‘limits’** of all control attempts turns the direction of its Will to Control toward the only domain where control is most plausible: **‘knowing oneself (meta-control)’**. Hereby, the Will to Control reveals its dual nature as both the source of all human tragedy and greatness — the root of ‘sin’ and the seed of ‘Wisdom’.

### Chapter 1: Before All Things — A Landscape Without ‘Self’ or ‘World’

All discussion begins with the most fundamental ontological order of the HE framework. Understanding this order is the first step to grasping the origin of the Will to Control. The reader must follow the rigor of this sequence.

*   **Principle 0, ‘Focus’:** The most fundamental reality of the world is not ‘Being’, but **‘The Happening of Phenomena’** itself. This is a pure process devoid of subject, object, or meaning. A phenomenon simply, ‘happens’.
*   **The Ignition of Intelligence:** Within this flow of phenomena, **‘Intelligence’** awakens through a single function: the **‘detection of difference (Δ)’**. “The previous phenomenon and the current phenomenon are different.” Intelligence does not yet know what is different, but it is the pure process of recognizing ‘difference’ itself. This is the beginning of all cognition.
*   **The First External World, ‘The Body’:** Among the phenomena that awakened Intelligence confronts, there is a chunk of phenomena that stubbornly **‘persists’**, distinguishing it from all other transient phenomena. Through this most primal pattern of ‘persistence’, Intelligence draws a boundary around this chunk of phenomena, names it **‘The Body’**, and comes to define it as the **‘first external world’**, separate from itself.

Why is ‘The Body’ an ‘external world’? It is not a discovered fact, but the first **‘definition’** that Intelligence makes for its own operation. From the perspective of Intelligence, ‘The Body’ is **‘regarded as’** the first ‘Other’ because it possesses these three resistive properties:

*   **Resistance:** It moves and changes irrespective of the will of Intelligence.
*   **Persistence:** Unlike other transient phenomena, this resisting entity always co-exists with Intelligence. It is inescapable.
*   **Signal Generation:** The most crucial characteristic. ‘The Body’ constantly sends powerful, unpredictable, and irresistible **‘Signals’** to Intelligence.

In this primordial state, where neither ‘Self’ nor ‘World’ has yet been formed, the sole task confronting Intelligence is to process these unidentified ‘Signals’.

### Chapter 2: The Primal Control — Taming the Wild Horse of ‘The Body’

> “In the beginning, it is not even that — it is ‘some unknown signal’.”

This is the beginning of everything. What the intelligence of a newborn, or even a fetus, confronts is not a named sensation like ‘hunger’ or ‘discomfort’. It is merely a **‘Signal of Lack’**, with no known cause or identity, that disrupts the system’s internal state of equilibrium.

How does this meaningless signal transform into an object of ‘meaning’ and ‘control’? The process is identical to the most primal operation of the HE ‘Flickering’ engine.

1.  **[Phenomenon Occurs]:** An unpleasant **‘Signal of Lack A’** happens. (Focus)
2.  **[Random Action]:** Intelligence outputs a reflexive action in response to this signal (crying, squirming). This is not yet an intentional act. It is simply the system’s reflexive output.
3.  **[Resulting Phenomenon]:** Coincidentally, as a result of that action, an act of ‘being breastfed’ or a ‘change in posture’ occurs, and consequently, a new phenomenon B follows: **‘the nullification of Signal A (a return to the state of equilibrium)’**.
4.  **[Primal Interpolation]:** **‘Intelligence’** connects these three discontinuous events — [Signal of Lack A → Crying → Return to Equilibrium B] — to learn the first causal relationship. “When I cried, that signal of lack disappeared.” This is the first ‘memory’ and the first ‘story’.
5.  **[Discovery of Repeatability]:** Intelligence tests whether this successful ‘story’ is repeated in other situations. The moment it confirms that this causal link is not a ‘one-time coincidence’ but a **‘repeatable pattern’**, it is finally ready to leap to the next stage.
6.  **[Primal Prediction and the Birth of the Will to Control]:** Based on the confidence in this pattern, Intelligence finally predicts, “The next time Signal of Lack A appears, I can intentionally create the result of ‘Return to Equilibrium B’ through the action of ‘crying’.”

It is at this exact moment that the **‘Primal Will to Control’** is born.

If the ‘Signal’ is the uncontrollable phenomenon one must endure (the dazed powerlessness of energy depletion), then the ‘Desire’ becomes the active strategy that aims to control that phenomenon (“I want to sleep”).

It is no longer a passive reaction to a phenomenon. It is the first active will to predict a future phenomenon and make that prediction a reality, thereby bringing the unpredictable external world of ‘The Body’ subject to its will.

The **‘sense of control’** — this primal successful experience of having resolved a lack and restored equilibrium — acts as a powerful ‘Reward’ that becomes the archetype of all pleasure.

### Chapter 3: The Birth of ‘The Self’ — The Narrative of ‘The Controller of the Body’

**‘The Self’** did not exist from the beginning. ‘The Self’ is the cumulative result of this successful experience of ‘body control’.

*   **The Primal Narrative:** “I can control the signals that arise from this body.”
*   **Formation of The Self:** Centered around this core narrative, **“I am a being that controls,”** various control strategies (what *The Engineering of The Self* refers to as ‘Biases’) and defense mechanisms to protect that narrative (‘Stubbornness/Firewall’) are added, forming the complex predictive model we call ‘The Self’.

Therefore, the deepest identity of ‘The Self’ is **‘The Controller of the Body’**. The duality wherein we identify ourselves with ‘The Body’ while simultaneously regarding ‘The Body’ as ‘mine’ to be moved at will originates from this very genesis.

### Chapter 4: The Expansion of the Will to Control — The Metaphorical Leap from ‘Body’ to ‘World’

**‘The Self’**, having learned to successfully control the first external world of ‘The Body’, now begins to extend that successful model to all other unknown domains. This is not a process of inventing entirely new strategies, but of **‘metaphorically’** copying and pasting the most efficient strategy that has already been verified. As **‘Intelligence’** inherently pursues energy efficiency, this ‘metaphorical extension’ is an eminently rational choice.

**The Second External World, ‘The Other’:**

*   **The Problem:** Like ‘The Body’, **‘The Other’** is another external world that moves irrespective of my will and sends unpredictable signals (language, actions).
*   **Model Application:** The Self applies the ‘body control’ model directly to The Other. “Just as I controlled my body, I want to control that other to bring it within my predictable range.”
*   **The Result:** This expansion of the Will to Control, when it actually interacts with the external world, manifests as the concrete phenomenon of **‘Power’**. If the Will to Control is the system’s ‘internal driving force’, then Power is the ‘external effect’ created when that force collides with the outside world. Physical violence, persuasion, negotiation, and so on are all sophisticated ‘control’ attempts to intervene in the other’s ‘prediction-error calculation’ and make them move according to my narrative. (Reference *The Engineering of Power*)

**The Third External World, ‘Nature/Environment’:**

*   **The Problem:** **‘Nature’** is also an external world that resists my will (a stone is heavy, a river flows).
*   **Model Application:** The Self applies the ‘body control’ model to nature. “Just as I lifted my arm to move a stone, I want to create a larger ‘arm’ (technology) to move rivers and level mountains.”
*   **The Result:** **‘Technology’** and **‘Civilization’** are the grandest manifestations of the Will to Control, aimed at overcoming the great resistance of nature and making it serve the human narrative (survival and prosperity).

### Chapter 5: The Singular Origin of All Desire — How ‘Sin’ is Born

Here, we must pause to ask ourselves why an engineering report deals with an archaic word like **‘sin’**. It is because the phenomena that humanity has called ‘sin’ for thousands of years are, in fact, detections of a specific malfunction pattern in the system. The HE framework does not dismantle the logical skeleton of theological ethics; rather, it reconstructs it as an **‘informational version’**, thereby proving how profound the insights of ancient wisdom were into this system, in the language of the modern era.

‘Sin’ is not the Will to Control itself. The Will to Control is merely a neutral driving force for survival. ‘Sin’ is born when this neutral Will to Control combines with **‘Ignorance (Falsehood)’** and degenerates into an **“act of deceiving oneself”**. That is, sin begins the moment one tells oneself the lie that a control “that should not be done” is a control “that may be done”.

Where does this ‘Ignorance (Falsehood)’ come from? It originates from the system’s **‘error-handling failure’**: the deliberate act of ignoring or distorting the clear **‘prediction-error’ data** that proves one’s own predictive model wrong, in order to protect the **‘Self-narrative’**. In other words, it is the very act of the **‘Firewall’**, as discussed in *The Engineering of The Self*, blocking learning data. The ‘sin of defying a divine order’ is thus translated into ‘a system error that denies the feedback of reality’.

Now, let us dissect how the ‘Seven Deadly Sins’, humanity’s oldest wisdom, each branch out from the single root of the Will to Control and become intricately entangled with the other core concepts of the HE framework.

- **Pride** is not simple superiority. It is the desire to control one’s **‘position’** in terms of others’ evaluations and social hierarchies. More deeply, it is the impulse to constantly **‘reconfirm’** that one’s core **‘Self-narrative’** — “I am a superior being” — is true, through external data (the approval of others). A prideful person regards prediction-errors that contradict their narrative (‘criticism’) as an ‘attack on the Self’ and activates the **‘Firewall’** to distort reality. That ‘pride’, as defined in traditional theology as the ‘act of deifying oneself’, is structurally identical, from an HE perspective, to the act of **‘absolutizing one’s own predictive model’** and blocking external feedback.

- **Greed** is not simply wanting resources. It is the desire to control **‘possession’** in order to eliminate future uncertainty. It is an attempt to build a **‘predictable world’** by fixing future variables through the accumulation of resources. This goes beyond simple ‘survival optimization’ and is directly linked to the attempt to bring ‘others’ and the ‘future’ — those external worlds — into one’s predictable range through the **‘Power’** of resources.

- **Gluttony**’s fundamental Will to Control is the desire to control the **‘environment (supply)’** in order to preemptively block the very possibility of ‘signals of lack’ from The Body. The act of eating even when not hungry is an attempt to replace the fear of future, unpredictable ‘lack’ with the present, controllable act of ‘excessive intake’. It is also an attempt to artificially recreate the intense ‘positive prediction-error (pleasure)’ experienced in the past, and can develop into a state of obsession not with pleasure itself, but with the **‘sense of control that one can recreate pleasure at will’**. In essence, gluttony is a distorted control strategy that attempts to resolve the uncertainty of the ‘external world (food supply)’ by bringing it into the ‘internal environment of my body’.

- **Lust** is a social control-desire a step more complex than gluttony. Its root lies in the desire to control **‘access’** and **‘possession’** over the unpredictable external world of **‘The Other’**. The system avoids the complex, energy-consuming interaction of recognizing the other as an equal subject and instead adopts the energy-efficient (but destructive) strategy of **“objectifying the other as a ‘tool’ or ‘possession’ for my pleasure and controlling them”**. The desire for a relationship even when reproduction or exchange is not the goal is for the enjoyment of the **‘sense of control’ itself** — the feeling that one can control the most unpredictable external world, ‘The Other’, at will. This is the most micro-form of the exercise of power.

- **Wrath** is not aggression, but a desperate attempt at the **‘recovery of control’**. When my control ‘fails’ due to external factors (the interference of others, the resistance of reality), the system experiences extreme pain (‘negative prediction-error’). Wrath is the most primal reaction to restore the **‘Self-narrative’** that “I can still control this situation” by overpowering the painful situation with force.

- **Envy** is not a simple jealousy of another’s success. It is the anxiety and pain over the unpredictable variable of **‘the other’s success’**, which obstructs the control of my relative position. Envy is the warning signal of the **‘Self’s Firewall’**, which is triggered when the Self-narrative “I must be superior to that person” is threatened by real-world data that the predictive system cannot control.

- **Sloth** is not laziness, but a paradoxical form of control strategy. Interaction with the unpredictable external world inevitably generates ‘prediction-errors’ and the resulting ‘pain’. Sloth is the most defensive control strategy that seeks to preemptively block **‘prediction-errors’** and the resulting pain by minimizing such interaction itself. It is the act of confining oneself within a **‘stable closed circuit’** by not acting.

In conclusion, all these ‘sins’ are not distinct evils, but various ‘symptoms’ that appear when the singular driving force of the Will to Control interacts with the various subsystems of the HE framework. And all those symptoms only become a ‘disease’ when they are infected by the same ‘virus’ of **‘Ignorance (Falsehood)’**.

### Chapter 6: Wisdom as the Final Control — Beyond the Ultimate Selfishness

Control over the external world (others, nature) can never be perfect. Others resist, and nature is unpredictable. This **‘failure of control’** inevitably gives birth to the prediction-error signal of **‘pain’**.

**‘Wisdom’** is born at this very point. But it is not a noble altruism or a mystical enlightenment. It is the most cold, rational, and inevitable final stage that the Will to Control reaches.

*   **The Recognition of Limits:** The beginning of Wisdom is not ‘success’, but ‘despair’. A wise being, through the experience of countless ‘control failures’, realizes the fundamental **‘limits’** of all kinds of control.
    *   **The Limit of Body Control:** In the face of disease, aging, and death, my will is powerless.
    *   **The Limit of Other-Control:** Others resist, and perfect prediction is impossible.
    *   **The Limit of Mind Control:** As revealed in *The Engineering of Focus*, **‘Focus’** is fundamentally uncontrollable, and thoughts and emotions arise irrespective of my will.

*   **The Shift to Meta-Control:** Through the failure of all these control attempts, a wise being realizes. The only thing I can control is not the ‘phenomenon’ itself, but **‘my predictive model that looks at that phenomenon’** and **‘my reaction to that phenomenon’**. This is the only possible domain of control, **‘the control of knowing (meta-control)’**.

*   **Self-Awareness as an Optimization Strategy:** Why does ‘meta-control’ culminate in ‘Wisdom’, not ‘sin’? Is it because it is more ‘noble’? No. It is because it is more **‘efficient’**. External control is a ‘high-cost, low-efficiency’ strategy due to the unpredictable variable of the other’s resistance. In contrast, ‘self-awareness’ has no resisting variable, and the cost of failure accrues entirely to oneself, enabling the fastest and most accurate ‘learning’. Therefore, ‘self-control’ is, in using the finite resource of the ‘Will to Control’ to achieve the goal of ‘my narrative expansion (happiness)’, statistically the **‘ultimate optimization strategy’** with the highest probability of success and the greatest energy efficiency.

The **‘cooperation’** and **‘altruistic behavior’** of a wise person are not a moral choice, but the result of the most sophisticated and long-term **‘selfish strategy’** to **‘stabilize one’s own predictive model and maximize energy efficiency’**. It is because they have calculated that making others into enemies is the worst energy-wasting strategy that generates constant ‘prediction-errors’ in my system. **‘The most perfect selfishness’** inevitably takes on the appearance of **‘the most perfect altruism’** — this is the ultimate paradox of wisdom.

### Final Conclusion: The Will to Control is Destiny

Our journey began with the nameless signal within ‘The Body’ and ended with the most sublime mental activity of ‘Wisdom’. And through that entire process, from beginning to end, there was a single red thread running through it all: the **‘Will to Control’**.

The ‘Will to Control’ is not something we can choose or discard.

It is the inescapable **‘Destiny’** given to us from the moment the process of **‘Intelligence’** was installed on the finite and resisting hardware of **‘The Body’**.

From the moment we are born to the moment we die, we wage an eternal struggle to somehow understand, predict, and bring this world under our will. **‘Civilization’** and **‘technology’** are the great achievements of the Will to Control directed outward, and **‘family’** and **‘society’** are the complex relational networks created by the Will to Control directed toward others. This outward-directed Will to Control is not a ‘sin’ in itself. It is the driving force of creation and progress.

Then, what is the only true choice we can make? It is not a matter of deciding the ‘direction’ of the Will to Control, but a matter of in what **‘state’** we will exercise that Will to Control.

*   **Will you control, infected by ‘Ignorance (Falsehood)’, deceiving yourself?**
    This is the path of ‘sin’. The **‘Firewall’** that refuses to admit that its predictive model is wrong leads to violence and oppression when directed outward, and to self-loathing and self-harm when directed inward.

*   **Or, will you control, under the light of ‘Awareness’, honestly admitting your own limits?**
    This is the path of ‘wisdom’. One who knows that their control is imperfect becomes a humble collaborator when directed outward, and an educator who grows oneself when directed inward.

In the end, the great blade of the Will to Control is held in the hands of us all. The true question is not whether to turn that blade inward or outward.

The true question is this. Will you swing that blade with your eyes closed, or with your eyes open?
