# HumanEngineering

> This is a work of first philosophy, executed with the precision of engineering. It deconstructs the observer's mind to establish the fundamental axioms that govern our construction of reality, from the simplest perception to the most complex thoughts.

## The 9 Theses of the Mind (The Core Principles)

The entire operating principle of the human system, as explored in this project, can be summarized in the following nine theses:

1.  **Intelligence** is the flickering between interpolation and prediction.
2.  **Consciousness** is the stage of experiencing and being aware of the continuous flow created by this flickering.
3.  **Emotion** is the feedback on prediction-errors.
4.  **Memory** is the narrative reconstruction between major prediction-error feedbacks.
5.  **The Present** is the imperceptible gap within the flickering between interpolation and prediction.
6.  **The Self** is the narrative entity composed of bias and stubbornness.
7.  **The Body** is the hardware that stores and executes habits, the shortcuts of bias.
8.  **The Will** is the directionality to unfold oneâ€™s narrative.
9.  **Action** is the execution of unfolding the highest-value narrative based on a risk/return assessment.

## Reading Path: The Architecture of the Theory

This project is a single, interconnected system of thought. To fully understand its structure, it is highly recommended to follow the logical order below.

#### **Part 0: The Axioms (First Principles)**
*The fundamental constraints of reality and perception.*

1.  **[The Vanished Present](./00_Axioms/001_The_Vanished_Present.md)** - *Why the engine must run.*
2.  **[The Discontinuous World](./00_Axioms/002_The_World_is_Discontinuous.md)** - *The nature of the data the engine processes.*

#### **Part 1: The Core Engine**
*The inevitable process born from the axioms.*

1.  **[The Engineering of Intelligence](./01_Core_Engine/001_The_Engineering_of_Intelligence.md)** - *How the engine flickers.*

#### **Part 2: The Core Architecture**
*The operating system created by the engine's operation.*

1.  **[The Engineering of Consciousness](./02_Architecture/001_The_Engineering_of_Consciousness.md)** - *The UI that renders reality and the control loop that governs it.*

#### **Part 3: The Subsystems (Applications & Hardware)**
*The key modules that run on, and interact with, the core architecture.*

1.  **[The Engineering of Emotion](./03_Subsystems/001_The_Engineering_of_Emotion.md)** - *The Feedback Module & Status Report.*
2.  **[The Engineering of Memory](./03_Subsystems/002_The_Engineering_of_Memory.md)** - *The Database & Reconstruction Engine.*
3.  **[The Engineering of The Self](./03_Subsystems/003_The_Engineering_of_The_Self.md)** - *The Master Application & Its Firewall.*
4.  **[The Engineering of The Body](./03_Subsystems/004_The_Engineering_of_The_Body.md)** - *The Legacy Hardware & Its Constraints.*
