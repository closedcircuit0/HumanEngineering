# HumanEngineering

> This is a work of first philosophy, executed with the precision of engineering. It deconstructs the observer's mind to establish the fundamental axioms that govern our construction of reality, from the simplest perception to the most complex thoughts.

## The 9 Theses of the Mind (The Core Principles)

The entire operating principle of the human system, as explored in this project, can be summarized in the following nine theses:

1.  **Intelligence** is the flickering between interpolation and prediction.
2.  **Consciousness** is the stage of experiencing and being aware of the continuous flow created by this flickering.
3.  **Emotion** is the feedback on prediction-errors.
4.  **Memory** is the narrative reconstruction between major prediction-error feedbacks.
5.  **The Present** is the imperceptible gap within the flickering between interpolation and prediction.
6.  **The Self** is the narrative entity composed of bias and stubbornness.
7.  **The Body** is the hardware that stores and executes habits, the shortcuts of bias.
8.  **The Will** is the directionality to unfold oneâ€™s narrative.
9.  **Action** is the execution of unfolding the highest-value narrative based on a risk/return assessment.
