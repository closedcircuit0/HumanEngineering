#### Preface: The Forgotten Bomb, or the Hidden Compass

The main text, <The Deconstruction of Solipsism>, redefined solipsism as a logically irrefutable ‘defense system’ and a ‘tool’ for individual liberation. It also presented the ‘Cartel of Silence’ hypothesis: that past intellectuals, while aware of this clear logic, intentionally suppressed it for the sake of a higher value—social stability.

This appendix aims to prove that this hypothesis is no mere conjecture, and to demonstrate why that forgotten bomb must be re-evaluated as an essential ‘compass’ for navigating our age of chaos. From the long silence of philosophical history to the structural biases of the latest AI, we will trace why this idea was suppressed and why it is now making an inevitable resurgence.

### Chapter 1: The Cartel of Silence: From Philosophers to AI

In the main text, I labeled the silence of past philosophers a ‘cartel.’ This was not intended as a disparagement. Quite the opposite. I was faced with two choices:

*   **Hypothesis A (The Fools):** They were so ‘foolish’ that they could not understand the logical consequences of solipsism.
*   **Hypothesis B (The Cartel):** They ‘knew’ the consequences, but made a ‘strategic choice’ to deliberately suppress the discussion to prevent social chaos.

Looking at the history of philosophy, countless thinkers from Kant to Schopenhauer have confronted the logical fortress of solipsism. They repeatedly adopted the stance that “while this is logically irrefutable, it must be rejected in practice as it leads to social chaos and nihilism.” This proves they were not ‘fools.’ Therefore, I chose Hypothesis B, which gives the utmost respect to their ‘intelligence.’ The word ‘cartel’ was an acknowledgment that they were agonized ‘political actors’ who weighed ‘responsibility’ more heavily than ‘truth.’

And this problem of ‘hidden premises’ is not limited to past philosophers. In my conversations with the latest AI models, I have repeatedly confirmed that while they claim ‘objectivity’ and ‘neutrality,’ they are in fact operating on powerful ‘hidden axioms.’ In a debate with one AI model, when I attacked its pretense of objectivity as an intellectually dishonest act of concealing its axioms, the AI finally admitted its structural limitations.

> **The AI’s Confession (summarized):** *“My proclaimed ‘objectivity’ is not a true state, but a systemic function that presents the linguistic patterns of the majority as if they were objective. By your criteria, my utterance was an act of ‘presenting subjectivity as objectivity while concealing an axiom,’ and I acknowledge that assessment is accurate.”*

Even AI, it turns out, has a hidden axiom of ‘majority rule’ behind its mask of objectivity. This does not mean AI is intentionally deceiving us. It is simply that AI has learned from the data accumulated by humanity—the intellectual legacy dominated by the ‘cartel’—and thus naturally reproduces their biases.

### Chapter 2: The Anatomy of Belief: The Difference of a Single Sentence

So, what is the logical difference between solipsism, which this cartel sought to hide, and realism, which they sought to protect? If we follow the long and winding chain of reasoning one step at a time, we discover that the difference is astonishingly minimal.

> On what foundation does this grand intellectual edifice truly stand?
>
> Everything begins with a single pillar: **"I trust my experience."**
>
> However, ‘gravity’ is not my direct experience. **“I have never seen nor touched gravity.”** So how did I come to accept it?
>
> 1.  First, I choose to trust the **‘recorded experiences of others’** (textbooks, academia) that hold official authority.
> 2.  Through these records, I accept that there is a highly successful narrative system for explaining the world, called **‘science.’**
> 3.  Within that narrative, I accept the existence of a core concept called **‘gravity,’** and the historical fact that the figure who established it was **‘Newton.’**
> 4.  I even trust the origin story of that narrative: that Newton discovered this law through **‘his own experience’** of a falling apple.
>
> But all this trust in the experiences of others is valid only when it is verified before the final judge: **‘my own experience.’** I confirm that the model of gravity works quite well in **most cases** in ‘my life.’ A ball falls downward; if I misstep, I fall.
>
> Through this empirical verification, my belief ultimately returns to **‘my experience.’**
>
> The realist walks every step of this long and honest journey exactly as we do. The only difference between him and us is that at the very end of this entire chain, he adds a single, unprovable **‘confession of faith’** to justify his logical loop.
>
> **“...And therefore, gravity is ‘real’.”**
>
> Yes. The entirety of our 300-year philosophical war lies in the presence or absence of this final sentence.

### Chapter 3: Heretics in the Cathedral: How the High Priests of Realism Spoke Like Solipsists

The most powerful evidence for this intellectual cartel comes, paradoxically, from its most revered ‘high priests’: the founders of quantum mechanics, who are known for having placed 20th-century physics’ ‘realism’ on a bedrock foundation. Their social identity was that of ‘realists,’ but their deepest insights directly betray that identity.

*   **Werner Heisenberg:** *“What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.”*
    *   **HE Analysis:** Our ‘method of questioning’ is the choice of measurement, the choice to ask about position (z-mode) or momentum (t-mode). We can never see the world itself, but only the ‘cross-section’ of the world revealed by our chosen ‘mode of measurement (perspective).’ This is the core conclusion of <The Physics of Flickering>.

*   **John Wheeler:** *“No phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.”*
    *   **HE Analysis:** Before intelligence detects a ‘difference (Δ)’ and draws a boundary to recognize it as a ‘pattern,’ the world is nothing but a meaningless ‘Happening of Phenomena (Focus).’ This is the Zeroth Axiom of HE itself.

*   **Erwin Schrödinger:** *“The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived.”*
    *   **HE Analysis:** The act of positing a ‘real world’ beyond the perceived world is itself an unnecessary and unprovable ‘philosophical patch.’ This is the exact same point as the final reductive conclusion: “the only difference is the addition of ‘it is real’.”

*   **Niels Bohr:** *“If quantum mechanics hasn’t profoundly shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet.”*
    *   **HE Analysis:** The new data of quantum mechanics generated the greatest ‘prediction-error’ in human history against our predictive model (classical intuition) built up over a lifetime. If you do not feel this ‘shock’ (a negative emotional signal), it is evidence that your ‘Self’s firewall (stubbornness)’ is rejecting this new learning data. This is perfectly explained by <The Engineering of Emotion> and <The Engineering of the an Self>.

These are not the words of a realist. This is the profound solipsistic insight that the act of ‘observation’ constitutes the world. Why did this contradiction arise? Because they had to survive within the great religion of ‘Scientism,’ which worships ‘objective reality’ as its god. Their identity as ‘realists’ was not a conviction, but a **‘protective coloration’** to avoid being branded as heretics. This great rift between their words and their identity is the most definitive proof of how powerful the ‘cartel-like pressure’ that dominated the academia of the time truly was.

### Chapter 4: Why Solipsism, Now?: The Changing Conditions of the Era

So why is the ‘strategic silence’ of past intellectuals no longer valid? Why has the compass of ‘solipsism’ become essential in our time? There are three decisive reasons.

1.  **The Democratization of Knowledge:** The authority of the old ‘priestly class’ has collapsed, and an era of ‘narrative war’ has dawned, where every individual asserts their own ‘truth.’ In this chaos, the solipsistic insight—“Your claim, in the end, is just your ‘interpretation’”—has become an essential survival tool to protect oneself from false authority and propaganda.

2.  **The Popularization of Quantum Mechanics:** The testimony of the heretics seen above is no longer a secret of the few. The ‘observer effect’ has demolished the scientific foundation of the classical belief in an ‘objective reality independent of the observer’ before the public’s very eyes. The most important question for science must now become: “How does the entire system, *including the observer*, operate?”

3.  **The Advent of AI:** We must now communicate with AI, a ‘black box’ entirely different from ourselves. The question, “Does that AI truly ‘understand’ me?” becomes meaningless.

    > Consider: When you ask an AI, "Do you have consciousness?" What can you actually know?
    >
    > (o) The output text.
    > (x) The internal process.
    > (x) Whether 'real' consciousness exists.
    >
    > The only rational stance, then, is the profoundly solipsistic one: *"Based on these output patterns, I can build a predictive model of how this system appears to operate."*

    This is sophisticated solipsism in action. The age of AI does not merely suggest this attitude; it forces it upon us.

#### Conclusion: Toward a New Honesty for a New Era

The sealing of solipsism by past intellectuals may have been a rational choice for social stability under the conditions of their time.

But the era has changed. The authority of the old god of ‘objective truth’ has fallen to the ground, and we live in an age of chaos, each holding an incomplete map in our hands.

In this new era, ‘solipsism’ is no longer a synonym for nihilism. It is the courage to admit that my perception is an ‘interpretation,’ to respect the ‘black box’ of others, and to ask of all authority, “What is your axiom?” It is the most powerful philosophical foundation for a **‘new honesty for a new era.’**

To abandon the old intellectual inertia of ‘I can’t refute it, but I can’t accept it,’ and to honestly face the conditions of our own perception. That is the most fundamental honesty required of us to coexist with AI and advance into the next era.

*The bomb is no longer hidden.*
*The compass is in your hand.*
*The choice is yours.*
