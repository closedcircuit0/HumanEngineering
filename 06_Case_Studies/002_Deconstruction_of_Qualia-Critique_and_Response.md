## 1. Critique by Matthew Chenoweth Wright

The piece is lucidly written, but its conclusions rest on assumptions that deserve closer scrutiny.

1.  **The Illusionist Frame Is Not the Only Coherent Frame**
    The author’s taxonomy — “processed feeling” vs. “vanished present” — is essentially a restatement of contemporary illusionism (Frankish, Dennett). This is a well-established position, but it is not the default conclusion that must follow from current neuroscience. Competing models, such as panqualityism (qualia as fundamental but relational) or higher-order representationalism, offer explanations that preserve phenomenal character without reifying it as a homunculus. Ignoring these alternatives makes the dismissal of qualia premature.

2.  **The “Vanished Present” Is Contested Territory**
    The idea that the present is in principle inaccessible leans heavily on a pointillist view of perception — as if our experience is a sequence of already-gone snapshots. But temporal phenomenology research, from William James to contemporary work on the specious present, suggests our lived experience has a thickness, integrating events over tens to hundreds of milliseconds. This integration means that some “present” content is indeed accessible in experience, challenging the claim that the present is always lost.

3.  **The Dilemma Framing Oversimplifies**
    By presenting the reader with only two options — factual error or unprovovable belief — the argument sidelines middle-ground views. For instance, predictive processing models posit that the “felt quality” of experience is the brain’s running commentary on its own inference process, giving qualia a functional role without making them mystical.

4.  **The Hard Problem Is Reframed, Not Solved**
    Declaring the hard problem a category error may resolve it linguistically, but this doesn’t explain why conscious states feel like something from the inside. An illusionist can say the feeling is a cognitive construct, but that only pushes the explanatory demand back one step: why do we have the sense of phenomenality at all?

5.  **Engagement With the Literature Would Strengthen the Case**
    While the metaphors in The Deconstruction of Qualia are effective, the argument would benefit from engaging with the body of work it is implicitly addressing — Nagel’s “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”, Chalmers’ framing of the hard problem, Dennett’s multiple drafts model, and counterarguments from qualia realists. Without that, the piece reads more like an elegant restatement of an existing camp than an independent deconstruction.

**Conclusion:**

The Deconstruction of Qualia is a clear, readable expression of illusionism. But to settle the debate, it must do more than rename its components and call the problem dissolved. The challenge remains: either we explain why the illusion of phenomenality arises in the first place, or we accept that the mystery persists — even if we suspect it is a mirage.

## 2. The Author's (closedcircuit0) Reply

Hello, Matthew. Thank you for your deep and thoughtful engagement with my work.

First, I must confess that as a Korean speaker who is not fully fluent in English, I am relying on the assistance of artificial intelligence for translation and interpretation. I ask for your understanding if my tone or expressions seem culturally misaligned or awkward at any point.

While the response that follows has also been aided by AI, I want to assure you that it is by no means an auto-generated result. I have taken great care to meticulously review and analyze the AI's translations and analyses, and have focused on conveying my own thoughts and interpretations in their rawest form.

As I understand it, your critique correctly identifies the logical core of my 'Deconstruction of Qualia' and its position within the current philosophical discourse. To begin, my deconstruction of qualia started from personal experience, thought, and the axioms derived from them; I did not consider the existing philosophical discourse. Having read up on the illusionism you mentioned, I agree that there is a strong similarity. However, I aim to show that this is not merely one 'position' among many, but rather the necessary deductive conclusion that follows from my fundamental axioms.

Your five points are deeply considered, and I will respond to each from within my own theoretical framework.

**1. On the point that “The Illusionist Frame Is Not the Only Coherent Frame.”**

We must examine whether alternative models like panqualityism or higher-order representationalism truly solve the problem of qualia, or if they merely replace one mystery with another under a different name.

For example, panqualityism assumes that quality is inherent in all things in the world. However, in my article [The Engineering of Mathematics](../00_Frameworks/003_The_Engineering_of_Mathematics.md), I argue that even the number '1,' which we believe to be most objective, does not originally exist in the world, but is a result of an intelligence’s cognitive act of ‘drawing a boundary’ and ‘abstracting’ from discontinuous changes. In [The Engineering of Language](../00_Frameworks/002_The_Engineering_of_Language.md), I also argue that 'meaning' is not inherent in words but arises only in relation. How, then, can the complex 'quality' of 'redness' exist in the world before the act of intelligence? Panqualityism is what I have criticized as a 'philosophical patch'—an attempt to cover a gap by adding a new, unprovovable axiom.

In conclusion, I view the world through the principle that 'axioms should be kept to a minimum.' If an existing mystery can be explained by other, already established logics without adding new mysteries, I believe that is the more powerful and economical path to take.

**2. On the point that “The ‘Vanished Present’ Is Contested Territory.”**

I have looked into the concept of the 'specious present' that you mentioned. Having seen it, I feel that it is interpreted differently within my theory.

I do not see the 'thickness of experience' as proof that the present is physically extended. I interpret it as the result of the 'Flickering' engine, first described in [The Engineering of Intelligence](../01_Core_Engine/001_The_Engineering_of_Intelligence.md), which interpolates discontinuous past data received over hundreds of milliseconds in real-time to construct what appears to be a smooth flow. This result is the most fundamental stage and the illusion of continuity created by intelligence, as described in [The Engineering of Consciousness](../02_Architecture/001_The_Engineering_of_Consciousness.md).

Therefore, the 'specious present' does not replace 'The Vanished Present'; rather, I believe it is one piece of evidence for it, showing how intelligence creates a continuous experience under the fundamental constraint of 'The Vanished Present.' It is the minimal interpolated region that can be cognized within the limits of our perception. And it, too, is already 'distinguished and abstracted.'

**3. On the point that “The Dilemma Framing Oversimplifies.”**

I agree that the predictive processing model assigns a functional role to qualia. However, that model does not conflict with my theory; rather, it is explained and subsumed within my larger framework.

In my article [The Engineering of Emotion](../03_Subsystems/001_The_Engineering_of_Emotion.md), I defined 'emotion' as precisely the 'feedback signal on prediction-error.' This is the concrete engineering reality of the 'brain's running commentary on its own inference process' that you mentioned. The predictive processing model describes exactly this.

But the predictive processing model stops there. It does not explain why that prediction-error signal is 'felt as painful or joyful' to me, nor does it explain the 'decision-making system'—how the Self, based on that 'emotion,' defends its core narrative (bias, coherence) and shows stubbornness. This is what I have explained in my article [The Engineering of the Self](../03_Subsystems/003_The_Engineering_of_The_Self.md). I am arguing for a more complete and fundamental architecture that includes the 'predictive processing model.'

**4. On the point that “The Hard Problem Is Reframed, Not Solved.”**

The question, "Why do we have the sense of phenomenality at all?" is answered by my entire theoretical system, 'HumanEngineering.'

Why do we have 'feelings'? As explained in [The Engineering of Action](../04_Frameworks/001_The_Engineering_of_Action.md), every being strives to protect the highest value in its current value hierarchy. It must protect its own narrative. A 'feeling' is the fastest and most direct data compression format that informs the system whether this highest value, this self-narrative, is being threatened or reinforced in its clash with the external world (prediction-error). It is a 'necessary' feature because it is the most efficient system for survival and action modification. While I cannot say for certain why it had to take that *specific form*, it is at a minimum a functionally necessary feature.

**5. On the point that “Engagement With the Literature Would Strengthen the Case.”**

This point is correct. And this was my personal intention.

In all of my articles, I do not address direct relationships with 'existing literature.' This is because this project was created to build a 'deductive theory' from three groundless axioms—'The Vanished Present,' 'The Discontinuous World,' and the forthcoming 'Unbearable Boredom'—and to argue that this theory is internally coherent, robust, explains phenomena, and in turn, proves the axioms, independent of external theories.

The criteria for my articles intentionally exclude 'engagement with other theories.' My four criteria are:

1.  Coherence with real-world experience.
2.  Internal coherence among the theories.
3.  Predictive power.
4.  Effectivity.

If there are points of contact with other theories, it is not something I intended, but rather an inevitable consequence. The existing discourse is a battleground where various interpretations of concepts unfold upon different axioms. Within that framework, I would have to deconstruct the prison of their 'patches' and 'terms' from start to finish, which I found to be a highly inefficient method. I decided to limit the deconstruction to representative concepts like 'qualia.'

Once again, thank you for your deep critique.
