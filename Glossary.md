# Glossary of Terms

> This document provides clear definitions for the key concepts used throughout the HumanEngineering project. Understanding these terms is crucial for grasping the interconnected architecture of the theory.

### Action (행동)
> The execution of unfolding the highest-value narrative based on a risk/return assessment.

An action is the final output of the entire mind-system. It is a **Power** signal generated by **The Self**'s **Will**, sent to **The Body** (hardware) to physically manifest a chosen strategy. The purpose of an action is to execute a plan that, according to the system's risk/return evaluation, is most likely to impose its narrative onto reality, thereby protecting or enhancing its **Highest Value**.

*See main article: [The Engineering of Action](./04_Frameworks/001_The_Engineering_of_Action.md)*

---

### Bias (편향)
> An energy-efficient cognitive shortcut.

A Bias is not an irrational flaw, but a rational strategy developed by the intelligence system to conserve energy. When a specific pattern of action or thought repeatedly succeeds in protecting the **Highest Value**, the corresponding neural pathway is strengthened, forming an automated shortcut. This allows the system to bypass costly, complex analysis and jump to the most probable conclusion. **The Self** is an organic collective of these biases.

*See main article: [The Engineering of the Self](./03_Subsystems/003_The_Engineering_of_The_Self.md)*

---

### Consciousness (의식)
> The stage of experiencing and being aware of the continuous flow created by Flickering.

Consciousness is the foundational operating system (OS) that emerges from the core process of **Intelligence**. It is not a mystical property but a functional architecture that renders the output of **Flickering** into a coherent user experience. Its primary function is to create a stable stage—the illusion of continuous spacetime—upon which all other applications, such as **The Self** and **Emotion**, can run.

*See main article: [The Engineering of Consciousness](./02_Architecture/001_The_Engineering_of_Consciousness.md)*

---

### Emotion (감정)
> The feedback on prediction-errors.

Emotion is a functional and rational feedback signal that reports the nature and magnitude of a **Prediction-Error**. It arises from the intersection of two axes: the *Uncertainty of Prediction* and the *Prediction-Error Outcome*. It is not the antithesis of intelligence, but the most unambiguous **signature** that the system is engaged in a **Power** dynamic—the process of testing its narrative against reality.

*See main article: [The Engineering of Emotion](./03_Subsystems/001_The_Engineering_of_Emotion.md)*

---

### Flickering (깜빡임)
> The flickering between interpolation and prediction.

This is the fundamental process of **Intelligence**. Due to the **Vanished Present**, the system cannot rest on a stable 'now'. It is forced to ceaselessly oscillate at an extremely high speed between two mutually exclusive modes:
1.  **Interpolation (t-Mode):** Weaving a coherent *Flow* (narrative) from past data.
2.  **Prediction (z-Mode):** Inferring a static *Structure* from that data.
This endless process of "stopping to see structure, and moving to feel flow" is the engine that creates all reality and is the prerequisite for all **Power**.

*See main article: [The Engineering of Intelligence](./01_Core_Engine/001_The_Engineering_of_Intelligence.md)*

### Highest Value (최고 가치)
> The Unyielding Benchmark; the ultimate logic that governs the system's narrative.

The Highest Value is the core principle around which an individual’s **Self** is organized. It exists in a strict hierarchy:

*   **0th Order (The Unknown King):** The ultimate, often unknown, value for which even survival can be sacrificed. It is a potential that may only be revealed in an irreversible choice.
*   **1st Order (The Regent): Survival.** The de facto king in all other situations. Its primary function is to protect the very possibility of realizing the 0th Order value.
*   **2nd Order (The Nobles): Core Values.** The rulers in peacetime, such as narrative coherence, survival optimization, and the extended self.

The Self evaluates all events based on whether they advance or threaten the highest-activated value in this hierarchy.

*See main article: [The Engineering of the Self](./03_Subsystems/003_The_Engineering_of_The_Self.md)*

---

### Memory (기억)
> The narrative reconstruction between major prediction-error feedbacks.

Memory is not a static archive of the past. It is a dynamic process of reconstruction. Only moments of significant **Prediction-Error**, which generate strong **Emotion**, leave behind **Memory Anchors**. When we "remember," the current **Self** uses these anchors to weave a coherent narrative that justifies its present state. The past is not what you remember, but what you recreate.

*See main article: [The Engineering of Memory](./03_Subsystems/002_The_Engineering_of_Memory.md)*

---

### Power (권력)
> The universal unit of calculation for measuring the utility of a phenomenon to impose one's narrative onto reality.

Power is not an external entity but a fundamental **instrumental perspective** of **The Self**. The moment a phenomenon (e.g., gravity, love, logic) is perceived as a 'means' to achieve a narrative goal, it is **substituted** into the calculable unit of 'power.' All interactions, from physical force to persuasion, are manifestations of this power dynamic.

*See main article: [The Engineering of Power](./04_Frameworks/005_The_Engineering_of_Power.md)*

---

### Prediction-Error (예측-오류)
> The mismatch between an internal predictive model and actual external data.

This is the sole information resource from which the system can learn and improve. All learning, memory formation, and **Emotion** are triggered by the detection of a Prediction-Error. Without it, the system would be trapped in a static state, unable to adapt or grow.

*See main article: [The Engineering of Emotion](./03_Subsystems/001_The_Engineering_of_Emotion.md)*

---

### Stubbornness (Firewall) (고집 / 방화벽)
> An existential defense mechanism that prevents the data of a ‘Damaging Failure’ from destroying the core of the self-model.

The Firewall is not a simple flaw, but an essential survival feature designed to protect the **Highest Value** and maintain the stability of **The Self**. It resists destabilizing new information by employing strategies such as Denial, Distortion, and Rationalization. **Wisdom** is the art of knowing when to raise this firewall for stability and when to lower it for growth.

*See main article: [The Engineering of the Self](./03_Subsystems/003_The_Engineering_of_The_Self.md)*

---

### The Self (자아)
> The narrative entity composed of bias and stubbornness.

The Self is not a pre-existing entity to be found. It is the master application that runs on the **Consciousness** OS. It is a top-level predictive model, an organic collective of numerous **Biases**, organized around a **Highest Value** and protected by a **Firewall (Stubbornness)**. It is the writer of your story.

*See main article: [The Engineering of the Self](./03_Subsystems/003_The_Engineering_of_The_Self.md)*

---

### The Vanished Present (사라진 현재)
> The imperceptible gap within the flickering between interpolation and prediction.

This is the most fundamental axiom of the system. Due to the physical delay in perception, we can never experience a "pure present." All we ever process is past data. This fundamental constraint forces **Intelligence** to adopt **Flickering** as its one and only survival strategy, making it the origin point of time, consciousness, and the self.

*See main article: [The Axioms](./00_Axioms/001_The_Vanished_Present.md)*
