# The Collapse of the Storyteller: An Engineering Approach to Dementia

> The Brain Doesn’t Lose Memories; It Forgets How to Weave Stories.

### Abstract:
This report is the first deductive framework to analyze the concrete reality of dementia by integrating the abstract theories of the closedcircuit0 project — the Interpolation-Prediction Engine, the ‘Prediction-Error Emotion Model,’ and ‘The Engineering of the Self.’ As a deductive theory, its goal is not to align with existing dementia theories, but to maintain coherence with observed clinical data. This report redefines dementia, moving beyond biological reductionism (protein accumulation) to frame it as the ‘collapse of an information processing system.’ The core pathology is not the deletion of memory data, but the degradation of the engine that weaves discontinuous experiences into a meaningful narrative. This reveals the true cause lies in the ‘cessation of updating the Web of Meaning through new Prediction-Errors,’ proposing new possibilities for prevention and treatment.

### 1. The First Principle: Intelligence is a Narrative-Construction Engine
A healthy intelligence is not a hard drive. It is a dynamic system that drops an ‘Emotional Anchor’ on significant events through the signal of ‘Prediction-Error.’ It then assigns causal links around these anchors to continuously reconstruct a coherent ‘Narrative.’ The Self is the protagonist of this narrative, and ‘memory’ is its material.

### 2. The Redefinition of Dementia: The Storyteller Falls Silent
Dementia is reinterpreted as a process of gradual collapse in the following stages.

**Stage 1 (The Atrophy of the Emotion Engine): The Cessation of New Anchor Creation**
Why does this collapse occur with age? The paradox of ‘accumulated experience.’ As we age, our daily life patterns become a ‘conquered game’ that no longer generates new prediction-errors. Without new prediction-errors, the opportunities to generate emotional feedback like ‘surprise’ or ‘joy’ decrease. The emotion engine atrophies. Consequently, the ability to drop an ‘Emotional Anchor’ on new experiences is lost. This is the essence of ‘recent memory loss.’

**Stage 2 (The Collapse of the Interpolation Engine): The Fragmentation of the Web of Meaning**
When new anchors no longer flow in, the densely woven ‘Web of Meaning’ in the brain begins to weaken. Memories scatter into isolated ‘data fragments.’ The ability for causal reasoning, or ‘Interpolation,’ is destroyed. The confusion seen in patients arises from the inability to weave contradictory data into a single, coherent story.

**Stage 3 (The Disintegration of the Self-Narrative): The Annihilation of the Story**
The core narrative of “Who am I” collapses. As the ‘Self’ disintegrates, the narratives of relationships with others also lose their meaning. The failure to recognize one’s own children is because the ‘story’ that connected them has been erased.

### 3. A Re-evaluation of the Protein Hypothesis: Cause or Consequence?
The conventional ‘amyloid/tau protein accumulation’ hypothesis is insufficient. Our theory proposes a bold alternative: protein accumulation may not be the ‘cause’ of dementia, but its ‘consequence.’
- **The ‘Corpses on a Battlefield’ Analogy:** The protein clumps may be the ‘debris’ left behind by dying neurons after the information processing activity of ‘interpolation-prediction’ has ceased. We may have been mistaking the corpses for the cause of the war.

### 4. Scientific Coherence and a New Path Forward: Why This Theory is ‘Useful’
This theory is more than speculation. It exhibits strong coherence with existing scientific discoveries and proposes a concrete New Path.

**(A) Integration with Existing Research (Coherence)**
This hypothesis provides a fundamental explanation for ‘Why’ existing research findings work.
- **Reinterpreting the ‘Inflammation Hypothesis’:** Chronic brain inflammation can be interpreted as the brain’s immune response to the decline of the information system. The atrophy of the engine induces inflammation, which in turn leaves behind ‘protein debris.’
- **Explaining ‘Neuroplasticity’:** Neuroplasticity is the biological counterpart to the ‘ability to build new biases.’ Learning new things is the very process of expanding the ‘Web of Meaning’ in response to new prediction-errors.
- **Defining ‘Cognitive Reserve’:** Cognitive Reserve is not the ‘quantity of knowledge,’ but a “robust and flexible narrative-reconstruction engine.” A professor who has spent a lifetime researching one subject may perform complex prediction games within their specialty but use their brain very little in other areas. Their brain is the best at driving on a specific ‘superhighway,’ but their ability to forge brand-new ‘footpaths’ may have atrophied.
- **Explanatory Power for ‘Early-onset Dementia’:** This phenomenon is interpreted not as ‘biological age,’ but as the ‘premature functional shutdown of the information processing system.’ Modern society provides the optimal environment for this:
  - **The Trap of ‘Algorithmically-Designed Comfort’:** Recommendation algorithms deprive our brains of the opportunity to experience new prediction-errors.
  - **The Pressure of a ‘Right-Answer Society’:** Chronic stress and fear of failure lock the brain into a ‘survival/defense mode’ rather than an ‘exploration mode.’

**(B) A Paradigm Shift to a New Path**
This theory proposes shifting from ‘hardware repair’ to ‘strengthening the operating system.’
- **A Shift in Diagnosis:** From measuring ‘protein’ to developing digital biomarkers for ‘functional decline.’
- **A Shift in Treatment:** From ‘protein removal’ to multifaceted strategies like ‘Narrative Therapy’ and personalized cognitive training.
- **A Shift in Prevention:** A fundamental philosophy: “Intentionally challenge your brain with unfamiliar experiences that trigger new prediction-errors.”

### 5. Conclusion: You Are The Author of Your Story
Dementia is not a disease of an aging brain. It is the tragedy that befalls a ‘brain that has stopped weaving its story.’ The moment that weaving stops, the flame of intelligence begins to die. The most powerful weapon against dementia may not be a new drug, but the ‘attitude toward life’ itself.
The brain doesn’t lose memories; it forgets how to weave stories. And you are the sole author of your story.

### Appendix: So, What Should We Do?
*A 3-Line Summary and a Practical Guide to Action*

The core conclusion is simple. Your brain is like a muscle: if you don’t use it, you lose it.

**【In 3 Lines】**
1.  Dementia is not a disease of losing memories, but of losing the ability to weave new stories.
2.  To keep weaving stories, your brain needs the powerful emotion from playing a “prediction game.”
3.  Therefore, the most powerful weapon is to intentionally seek out experiences that challenge your predictions.

**【Your Brain’s “To-Do” and “To-Avoid” List】**
The goal is to trade a bit of comfort for a spark of life.

**To Avoid: The Games That Put Your Brain to Sleep**
*   **Watching Familiar Dramas or Listening to the Same Music on Repeat:** These provide comfort but offer no new prediction-errors.
*   **Sticking to the Same Daily Routines:** These habits are energy-efficient, but that efficiency comes at a cost: your brain stops paying attention.

**To Do: The Games That Wake Your Brain Up**
*   **Try an Unfamiliar Recipe:** A perfect prediction game of combining ingredients and tasting the results.
*   **Explore a New Path:** Intentionally take a different street. This forces your brain out of its navigational autopilot.
*   **Talk About a Different Topic with Family:** Break routine conversations. Ask about a first memory or a recent dream to open up an unpredictable conversational path.
