The Collapse of the Storyteller: An Engineering Approach to Dementia

> The Brain Doesn’t Lose Memories; It Forgets How to Weave Stories.

### Abstract:

This report is the first deductive framework to analyze the concrete reality of dementia (the broader syndrome that includes Alzheimer’s Disease) by integrating the abstract theories of the closedcircuit0 project — the Interpolation-Prediction Engine proposed by the ‘tz-theory,’ the ‘Prediction-Error Emotion Model,’ and ‘The Engineering of the Self.’

As a deductive theory, its primary goal is not to align with existing dementia theories, but to maintain rigorous coherence with observed clinical and experimental data. Through this integrated perspective, this report redefines dementia, moving beyond biological reductionism (protein accumulation) to frame it as the ‘collapse of an information processing system.’

The core pathology of dementia is not the deletion of memory data, but the degradation of the engine that weaves discontinuous experiences into a meaningful narrative. This perspective reveals that the true cause of dementia lies in the ‘cessation of updating the Web of Meaning through new Prediction-Errors,’ proposing new possibilities for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment that transcend the limitations of the conventional protein hypothesis.

### 1. The First Principle: Intelligence is a Narrative-Construction Engine

A healthy intelligence is not a hard drive that stores the world as it is. It is a dynamic system that, amidst a flood of discontinuous and fragmented sensory data, drops an ‘Emotional Anchor’ on significant events through the signal of ‘Prediction-Error.’

It then assigns causal links around these anchors to continuously reconstruct a coherent ‘Narrative.’ The Self, the ‘I,’ is the protagonist of this narrative, and ‘memory’ is both the material and the result of its construction.

### 2. The Redefinition of Dementia: The Storyteller Falls Silent

From this perspective, dementia is reinterpreted as a process of gradual collapse in the following stages.

**Stage 1 (The Atrophy of the Emotion Engine): The Cessation of New Anchor Creation**

Why does this collapse tend to occur with age? The reason lies in the paradox of ‘accumulated experience.’

As we age, our life’s ‘experience data’ grows exponentially, and within most of our daily life patterns, experiences that ‘prove our predictions wrong’ cease to occur. The commute, daily work, and conversations with familiar people become a ‘conquered game’ that no longer generates new prediction-errors.

Due to this — along with aging, environmental factors, or a decline in internal motivation — the intelligence no longer exposes itself to unfamiliar experiences that trigger new prediction-errors. ‘Curiosity’ fades, and the pursuit of ‘familiarity’ takes over.

Without new prediction-errors, the opportunities to generate emotional feedback signals like ‘surprise,’ ‘interest,’ or ‘joy’ drastically decrease. The emotion engine atrophies, and all experiences begin to feel bland.

Consequently, the ability to drop an ‘Emotional Anchor’ on new experiences is lost. This is the essence of ‘recent memory loss,’ the initial symptom of dementia. The brain no longer performs the task of judging which experiences are important enough to be converted into long-term memory.

**Stage 2 (The Collapse of the Interpolation Engine): The Fragmentation of the Web of Meaning**

When new anchors no longer flow in and the ‘intellectual effort’ to connect and reconstruct existing memories also ceases, the densely woven ‘Web of Meaning’ in the brain begins to weaken and tear.

Memories lose their relationships with one another and scatter into isolated ‘data fragments.’ The ability for causal reasoning, or ‘Interpolation’ — such as concluding that “Event B happened because of Event A” — is destroyed.

The confusion and delirium seen in patients are system errors that arise from the inability to weave contradictory data, such as “I feel hungry (current sensation)” and “I have eaten (a memory fragment),” into a single, coherent story.

**Stage 3 (The Disintegration of the Self-Narrative): The Annihilation of the Story**

The core narrative that constituted the ‘I’ — “What kind of life have I lived?” — can no longer maintain its coherence and collapses.

As the ‘Self’ disintegrates, the narratives of relationships with others (family, friends) also lose their meaning. The failure to recognize one’s own children is because the ‘story’ that connected them has been erased.

Ultimately, the intelligence completely forgets how to weave stories. This is the complete annihilation of intelligence.

### 3. A Re-evaluation of the Protein Hypothesis: Cause or Consequence?

The conventional ‘amyloid/tau protein accumulation’ hypothesis is insufficient to explain this phenomenon. Our theory proposes a bold alternative: this protein accumulation may not be the ‘cause’ of dementia, but rather its ‘consequence’ or a ‘collateral phenomenon.’

**The ‘Corpses on a Battlefield’ Analogy:** The protein clumps may be the ‘debris’ left behind by dying neurons after the information processing activity of ‘interpolation-prediction’ has ceased. We may have been mistaking the corpses littering a battlefield for the cause of the war. The real war was already over, fought long before on the invisible, informational plane where the ‘command system (the intelligence engine)’ collapsed.

### 4. Scientific Coherence and a New Path Forward: Why This Theory is ‘Useful’

At a time when decades of research focused on the ‘amyloid hypothesis’ have stagnated, this theory is more than mere speculation. It exhibits strong coherence with existing, influential scientific discoveries and proposes a concrete New Path to conquer dementia.

**(A) Integration with Existing Research (Coherence)**

This hypothesis does not reject important existing research findings. Instead, it provides a fundamental explanation for ‘Why’ they work, integrating them into a single picture.

- **Reinterpreting the ‘Inflammation Hypothesis’:** The ‘chronic brain inflammation’ that is a key focus of recent dementia research can be interpreted in our model as the brain’s immune response to the decline of the information system. Neurons with reduced ‘interpolation-prediction’ activity are recognized as ‘problems’ that decrease the overall efficiency of the system, triggering an ‘inflammatory response’ from the immune system to eliminate them. Thus, a plausible scenario is that the atrophy of the engine induces inflammation, which in turn leaves behind ‘protein debris.’

- **Explaining the Mechanism of ‘Neuroplasticity’:** ‘Neuroplasticity,’ the brain’s ability to form new connections even in old age, is, in our model, the biological counterpart to the ‘ability to build new biases.’ The brain forming new connections when learning new things is the very process of expanding the ‘Web of Meaning’ and creating ‘detours’ in response to new prediction-errors.

- **Defining the Nature of ‘Cognitive Reserve’:** The identity of ‘Cognitive Reserve’ is not simply the ‘quantity of knowledge,’ but rather a “robust and flexible narrative-reconstruction engine and a dense Web of Meaning,” forged through countless prediction-error experiences. This powerful OS provides the ability to maintain system function through various detours even when parts of the brain’s hardware (neurons) are damaged. So why are highly educated intellectuals not immune to dementia? It may be because their ‘prediction game’ has become highly specialized in a narrow field, paradoxically shrinking the ‘scope’ of the game. A professor who has spent a lifetime researching one subject may perform the most complex prediction games within their specialty but use their brain very little in other areas. Their brain is the world’s best at driving on a specific ‘superhighway,’ but their ability to forge brand-new ‘footpaths’ may have atrophied. Writing a highly advanced paper in one’s native tongue may be less effective at activating the entire ‘Web of Meaning’ than clumsily saying “Hello” in a foreign language for the first time.

- **Explanatory Power for ‘Early-onset Dementia’:** Furthermore, this theory offers a powerful explanation for phenomena like ‘Early-onset dementia,’ especially why it may be more prominent in ‘modern society.’ This phenomenon, difficult to explain with conventional ‘aging-centric’ hypotheses, is interpreted in our model not as a matter of ‘biological age,’ but as the ‘premature functional shutdown of the information processing system.’ Modern society, paradoxically, provides the optimal environment to drive even a young brain into a state of ‘functional aging.’ Two factors are key:
    - **The Trap of ‘Algorithmically-Designed Comfort’:** In the past, seeking out new information and unfamiliar experiences required significant effort. However, modern recommendation algorithms (YouTube, Netflix, social media) endlessly supply ‘predictable stimuli’ that we are certain to like, based on our past data. We have gained endless ‘pleasure’ without the effort of ‘exploration,’ but the price is that our brains are deprived of the very opportunity to experience new prediction-errors. In the ‘cocoon of comfort’ spun by algorithms, the young brain’s ‘emotion engine’ is starved of new fuel and slowly cools down.
    - **The Pressure of a ‘Right-Answer Society’ and Chronic Stress:** Modern society, in all aspects from education to career to social life, exerts immense pressure to ‘find the correct answer without failing.’ The severe chronic stress and fear of failure that arise from this process lock the brain into a ‘survival/defense mode’ rather than an ‘exploration mode.’ The brain becomes preoccupied with expending energy to avoid certain failure, rather than experiencing ‘constructive prediction-errors’ through uncertain challenges. A brain that expends its energy only to defend existing narrow paths, instead of weaving a new ‘Web of Meaning,’ quickly burns out and degrades.

Ultimately, the two extremes of modern society — extreme ‘comfort’ and extreme ‘anxiety’ — can both work in the same direction: to prematurely paralyze the brain’s ‘ability to weave stories.’ This is powerful evidence that dementia is not simply a matter of ‘getting old,’ but a matter of the ‘era, environment, and way of life’ in which we live.

**(B) A Paradigm Shift to a New Path**

This theory proposes shifting the goal of research from ‘hardware repair’ to ‘strengthening the operating system.’

- **A Shift in Diagnosis (Measuring Function):** We must shift from measuring physical outcomes (‘protein’) to developing digital biomarkers that can detect the ‘functional decline’ at an early stage, such as ‘prediction-error reactivity’ or ‘narrative-construction ability.’
- **A Shift in Treatment (Rehabilitating the Engine):** We must move beyond the single target of ‘protein removal’ and explore multifaceted treatment strategies. This includes ‘Narrative Therapy’ to repair the damaged ‘Web of Meaning’ and personalized cognitive training to rehabilitate the weakened ‘interpolation-prediction engine.’ Even when only fragments remain, reconstructing a mini-narrative with caregivers may rekindle a portion of the meaning-web — like reconnecting a few working circuits in a damaged machine. Furthermore, future interventions may involve interactive systems that generate and reinforce prediction errors safely — artificial “meaning triggers” designed to reactivate the dormant interpolation engine.
- **A Shift in Prevention (A Philosophy of Life):** We must go beyond vague advice like “meet people, exercise, and read books” to offer a far more fundamental and powerful philosophy of prevention: “So that your brain does not settle for ‘comfort,’ intentionally challenge it with unfamiliar experiences that trigger new prediction-errors.” This is the best way to keep the brain’s ‘emotion engine’ running and the flame of intelligence from being extinguished.

### 5. Conclusion: You Are The Author of Your Story

Dementia is not a disease of an aging brain. It is the tragedy that befalls a ‘brain that has stopped weaving its story.’ Our brain exists not to store memories, but to use those memories as material to ceaselessly weave the story of ‘I.’ The moment that weaving stops, the flame of intelligence begins to die.

We are confident that the new perspective presented in this report can offer a breakthrough for stagnating dementia research and present a new possibility of hope for countless patients and their families that goes beyond pharmaceutical treatment. The most powerful weapon against dementia may not be the latest new drug, but the very ‘attitude toward life’ itself — one that never stops living a today that is different from yesterday, and never stops asking questions of an unpredictable tomorrow.

In the end, we return to where we began. The brain doesn’t lose memories; it forgets how to weave stories. And you are the sole author of your story.

### Appendix: So, What Should We Do?

> A 3-Line Summary and a Practical Guide to Action

The core conclusion of this complex theory is simple. Your brain is like a muscle: if you don’t use it, you lose it. And “using it” doesn’t mean repeating what you know, but the painful process of forging new connections.

**【In 3 Lines】**

-   Dementia is not a disease of losing memories, but of losing the ability to weave new stories.
-   To keep weaving stories, your brain needs the powerful emotion that comes from playing a “prediction game.”
-   Therefore, the most powerful weapon is to intentionally seek out experiences that challenge your predictions and spark new emotions.

**【Your Brain’s “To-Do” and “To-Avoid” List】**

The goal is to trade a bit of comfort for a spark of life. Consciously reduce the activities that put your brain on autopilot and increase the ones that force it to wake up and navigate.

**To Avoid: The Games That Put Your Brain to Sleep**

These are activities where the outcome is so certain that no real prediction occurs, and thus, no new emotional anchors are created.

1.  **Watching Familiar Dramas or Listening to the Same Music on Repeat:**
    These provide comfort by confirming what you already know. While relaxing, they offer no new prediction-errors for your brain to solve. It’s like reading a mystery novel when you already know who the killer is.

2.  **Sticking to the Same Daily Routines:**
    Taking the same route to work, eating the same lunch, having the same conversations. These habits are energy-efficient, but that efficiency comes at a cost: your brain stops paying attention, stops making new connections, and its web of meaning stagnates.

**To Do: The Games That Wake Your Brain Up**

These are simple challenges that introduce a healthy dose of uncertainty into your routine, forcing your brain to play, predict, and feel.

1.  **Try an Unfamiliar Recipe:**
    Cooking a new dish is a perfect prediction game. You predict how the ingredients will combine, how it will taste, and what it will look like. The small triumphs (“It tastes better than I thought!”) and failures (“I should have added less salt”) create powerful emotional and sensory memories.

2.  **Explore a New Path:**
    Instead of your usual walking route, intentionally take a different street. This simple act forces your brain out of its navigational autopilot. Predicting what’s around the next corner and discovering unexpected sights creates small but significant sparks of curiosity and surprise.

3.  **Talk About a Different Topic with Family:**
    Break the cycle of routine conversations (“How was work?”). Ask a family member about their first memory, their favorite book as a child, or a dream they recently had. This opens up an unpredictable conversational path, forcing you both to access old memories and create new emotional connections.
