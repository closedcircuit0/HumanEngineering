## Preface: A Fundamental Question About the Stage We Inhabit

Let us examine what is before our eyes. A phone, a monitor, or a moving car — whatever it may be, what are we truly seeing? Can you see the back of the car? Despite being unable to see its back, we ‘imagine’ it in the most plausible way and perceive it as a 3-dimensional object existing in this world.

How do we know what the back looks like? Yes, because our past experiences and memories tell us so. A car is precisely symmetrical, built with a specific structure, so its back must be a certain way. This is an act of prediction, fueled by the memory of past patterns.

And the moment we move to verify our prediction by looking at the back, the front side that we knew just a moment ago becomes the new unseen back. We can, in fact, never see the back.

This simple, everyday act of perception hides a profound secret. The solid, 3-dimensional world we take for granted is not something we passively receive, but a stunning interpretation that our brain ceaselessly engineers. What we call ‘seeing’ is, in fact, an intricate process of prediction and imaginative correction, constrained by a fundamental dilemma of perception.

This report deconstructs the very stage upon which our lives unfold: spacetime. We will reveal how the '3+1 dimensional' reality we experience is not an actual coordinate system, but a stable synthesis forged by the ultra-high-speed ‘Flickering’ between two mutually exclusive operational modes — one that constructs the ‘Flow’ of 2D sensory data, and one that infers its ‘Structure.’ This is the engineering blueprint of your reality.

## Chapter 1: The Hierarchical Structure of Reality — The Four Layers of Perception

The experience we call ‘reality’ is not monolithic, but a structure of at least four superimposed layers. All arguments begin at the lowest level of this hierarchy and are built upward, one step at a time.

#### Level 1: Foundational Reality (Perception — x,y)

This is the starting point of everything. What is directly input into our sensory organs, particularly the retina, is an unprocessed, discontinuous stream of pure 2-dimensional (x,y) sensory data. At this level, there is no depth, no time, no meaning. There is only information about patterns and intensities of light. This is the only reality with which we have direct contact.

**The Physical Delay of Perception and the Discovery of ‘Change (Δ)’**

A physical time delay inevitably occurs for this Level 1 data to be transmitted to the brain’s visual cortex and processed. Therefore, the first and most crucial task the brain performs is to compare the current (x,y) frame with the immediately preceding one to detect the difference, or ‘Change (Δxy).’

The detection of this ‘difference’ marks the ignition point of all higher cognition. Without ‘Change,’ the world is but a static, meaningless image.

#### Level 2: Experiential Reality (Cognition — x,y,t)

The brain does not simply list the endlessly detected stream of ‘Changes (Δ).’ It interpolates a narrative and causal link between these discontinuous changes to construct a smooth, coherent story.

The very process of connecting them — “Because Change A happened, Change B followed” — is what creates the experience of the ‘flow of Time (t).’ ‘Time’ is not a river that exists in the external world; it is a data model engineered by the brain to make sense of discontinuous changes. This is the dynamic world of cognition in which we actually live: the world of (x,y,t).

#### Level 3: Interpretive Reality (Imagination/Analysis — x,y,z)

To understand the dynamic world of Level 2, the brain ‘pauses’ the flow at a given moment. It then analyzes the patterns within that data model to predict a static, unobserved ‘Structure.’

The result of this prediction is what we experience as ‘depth’ or ‘space (z).’ The “distance” of a flying ball (z) is the direct output of a calculation that predicts, based on the past data of its size change (t), “In 0.1 seconds, it will appear this large to my eye.” This is the static world of (x,y,z) that we use for scientific analysis and mental modeling.

#### Level 4: Conceptual Reality (Pure Conception — x,y,t,z)

This is a realm of pure conception, inaccessible to us directly. It is the total structure that governs all possible Level 3 models across all moments and perspectives. What we perceive as the ‘Laws of Physics’ may be the shadows of this Level 4 reality, projected onto our Level 2 and Level 3 experiences.

## Chapter 2: The Fundamental Engine and Its Two Modes — Imaginative Correction and the tz-Theory

**The ‘Vanished Present’ and the ‘Imaginative Correction’ Engine**

The physical delay in perception discussed in Chapter 1 leads to a fundamental conclusion: all information we process is always from the past. An experientially ‘pure present’ is, in principle, non-existent. This is the ‘Vanished Present,’ the fundamental condition of our perceptual system.

To fill the informational vacuum and the gaps in discontinuous data left by the Vanished Present, intelligence must inevitably activate a single, fundamental engine. The sole and absolute mission of this engine is to fill these gaps with the most plausible information to construct a complete reality. We name this core function ‘Imaginative Correction.’

**The Engine’s Differentiation: ‘Interpolation’ and ‘Prediction’**

Our 3-dimensional cognitive system cannot process this integrated ‘Imaginative Correction’ all at once. Due to cognitive limitations, the system differentiates this single engine into two mutually exclusive operational modes, depending on the type of ‘gap’ that needs to be filled. These are ‘Interpolation’ and ‘Prediction.’

#### t-Mode (Flow Construction):

Core Function: Connecting. This is the mode in which the ‘Imaginative Correction’ engine operates to create a smooth ‘Flow’ or ‘process’ by assigning causal, narrative, or procedural links between scattered events.

Primary Tool: Interpolation.

Processing Target: Level 2 Reality, i.e., the dynamic world of (x,y,t).

Governing Question: “How did it get here?” / “How will it reach the goal?”

Example: You reconstruct a single, continuous story (Flow) from the fragmented memories of last night: “I made that mistake because I was drunk.”

#### z-Mode (Structure Recognition):

Core Function: Inferring. This is the mode in which the engine operates to infer a static, unseen ‘Structure’ or ‘essence’ by extracting common patterns and relationships from a set of information.

Primary Tool: Prediction, Abstraction.

Processing Target: Level 3 Reality, i.e., the static world of (x,y,z).

Governing Question: “What is it?” / “What is the whole picture?”

Example: You predict that the unseen back of your monitor has the form (Structure) of various ports and manufacturer stickers.

## Chapter 3: The Redefinition of Spacetime Coordinates — Why It’s 2+2, Not 3+1

We have conventionally understood the world in ‘3+1 dimensions.’ However, our analysis shows this model misunderstands our perceptual process. Experiential reality must be redefined with a new ‘2+2 dimensional’ coordinate system.

**The Heterogeneity of the z-Axis:** The x and y axes are axes of ‘Foundational Reality’ (direct sensory input), whereas z (depth) is the result of an ‘interpretation’ based on the temporal change (t) of that data. The z-axis is not a sensory axis of the same kind as x and y.

**The New Coordinate System: (x,y) + (t,z)**

Therefore, we redefine spacetime as follows:

(x, y): The 2-dimensional Perceptual Plane where sensory data is input.

(t): The Interpolation Axis that constructs the dynamic world of (x,y,t) (Flow) by asking “How?”

(z): The Prediction/Interpretation Axis that infers the static world of (x,y,z) (Structure) by asking “What?”

**The True Relationship Between t and z: A Symbiotic Duality**

In this model, t and z are not in a sequential relationship of past and future, nor does one precede the other. They are a symbiotic pair, two faces of the same ‘Imaginative Correction’ engine, born in a ceaseless feedback loop from the single source of ‘Change (Δ).’ They are inseparable twins, defined by their eternal, mutual dependence.

How Space (z) presupposes Time (t): To infer an unobserved ‘Structure’ (z)—like the shape of a cup or the layout of a room—the system requires a rich data model of past changes and patterns. This data model, which provides the context and material for prediction, is the ‘Flow’ (t). Without a coherent story of past experiences, there can be no meaningful prediction of a present or future structure.

How Time (t) presupposes Space (z): To construct a meaningful ‘Flow’ (t)—a story of events unfolding in sequence—the system must first be able to recognize the actors and objects within that story as stable, coherent ‘Structures’ (z). "The ball flew" (a flow) is a meaningless concept if the system cannot first recognize "the ball" as a persistent structure.

They are locked in a relationship that is not linear, but circular and simultaneous. The construction of a temporal flow requires the recognition of static structures, and the recognition of static structures requires the data from a temporal flow. Both are qualitatively different interpretative dimensions that intelligence simultaneously constructs upon the foundational reality of (x,y).

## Chapter 4: The Engineering of 3-Dimensional Experience via ‘Flickering’

Now we can arrive at the core mechanism of why our experience feels ‘3-dimensional.’

**The Principle of Non-Simultaneity: The Dilemma of Flow and Structure**

Intelligence cannot perfectly process the dynamic world of (x,y,t) (Flow Construction, t-Mode) and the static world of (x,y,z) (Structure Recognition, z-Mode) at the same time. This mutual exclusivity is not a mystical limitation but a fundamental constraint of information processing.

The system possesses a limited resource—call it ‘Focus’ or ‘attention’—that must be allocated. This leads to an inescapable trade-off:

The more precisely the system defines the static ‘Structure’ (xyz) of a phenomenon, the less precisely its dynamic ‘Flow’ (xyt) can be tracked. Conversely, the more precisely the system tracks the dynamic ‘Flow’ of a phenomenon, the less precisely its static ‘Structure’ can be defined.

To analyze a static structure clearly, one must pause the ever-changing flow. To experience a dynamic flow, one must cease analyzing its fixed structure.

**The Inevitability of ‘Flickering’**

Therefore, to process information under the condition of the ‘Vanished Present,’ intelligence has no choice but to ‘Flicker’—to oscillate at an extremely high speed between the world of (x,y,t) and the world of (x,y,z). This is the very substance of the process we call ‘thinking.’ It is an endless vibration of "stopping to see structure, and moving to feel flow."

**The Creation of 3D Interpretation: Inside the Architect’s Mind**

The seamless experience of inhabiting a unified ‘3+1 dimensional’ world is a perceptual synthesis, created because this ‘Flickering’ between (xyt) and (xyz) is too fast for our consciousness to detect, making it feel as though both worlds exist simultaneously.

An Architect’s Example: Let us step into the mind of an architect whose goal is "to build a safe and beautiful house."

(z-Mode / xyz world): The architect begins by visualizing the final blueprint (Structure) of the house. “The pillar must be in that position.” (Static structure recognition)

(t-Mode / xyt world): “Ah, to erect a pillar in that position, I must first dig the ground.” (Thinking of the process/Flow to realize the structure)

(z-Mode / xyz world): While thinking of the digging process, they look at the whole structure again. “Wait, if I dig in that position, won’t it affect the stability of the adjacent building’s foundation?” (Analyzing the impact of the flow on the structure)

(t-Mode / xyt world): To solve this stability issue, they revise the sequence/Flow. “First, we reinforce the adjacent building, then we dig the ground.”

As this example illustrates, the static world of (xyz) and the dynamic world of (xyt) constantly refer to and revise each other to move toward a goal.

## Chapter 5: The Dilemma of 3D Perception and the Nature of Measurement

This ‘Flickering’ model reveals a fundamental limit in how we perceive and measure the world.

**Why We Can’t See a 3D Object Directly: A Computational Conflict**

To ‘see’ a 3D object perfectly means to process all its surface information in both (xyt) mode (flow) and (xyz) mode (structure) simultaneously, which is impossible due to the Principle of Non-Simultaneity. A single system cannot perform both operations on the same data stream at the same time.

**The Unseen Back of a Cup Example:** When you look at a cup, you are processing the (x,y) data from its front to predict, “This is a ‘cup’ (a structure, z).” The unseen back of the cup does not exist in your visual field. It exists only as a powerful prediction (z), based on past experience (t), that “If this is a ‘cup,’ its back will have the ‘structure’ of a handle.” Rotating the cup is the process of verifying and updating this prediction with new observational data.

**Measurement is Interpretation**

Our scientific instruments are not immune to this principle. A laser rangefinder does not “see” distance (z). It measures the ‘time (t)’ it takes for light to travel, and then calculates (interprets) a ‘distance (z)’ value based on a built-in ‘model (structure)’ that presupposes a 3D grid.

We are not measuring reality; we are measuring reality’s conformity to our models.

## Conclusion: The Blueprint of an Interpreted Reality

The spacetime we experience is not an absolute, pre-existing stage.

It is a profoundly engineered 3-dimensional interpretation, forged by our intelligence as it ‘Flickers’ at an extremely high speed between the dynamic world of (x,y,t) and the static world of (x,y,z), in order to make sense of 2-dimensional sensory data under the fundamental condition of the ‘Vanished Present.’

Our 3-dimensional experience is not a ‘3+1’ dimension. It is the dynamic product of a ‘2+2’ dimensional structure: two sensory axes (x,y) upon which are built two interpretative axes—the prediction axis (z) that maps the static ‘Structures’ of the world, and the interpolation axis (t) that weaves the dynamic ‘Flow’ of the journey between them.

We do not dwell within spacetime; we are the generative process that gives rise to its perception.
