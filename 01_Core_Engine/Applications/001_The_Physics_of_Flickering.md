The Physics of Flickering : From Subjective Time to Quantum Uncertainty

> The tz-Theory and The Flickering Reality

*The Origin of the Arrow of Time and Quantum Uncertainty: The Inevitable Consequence of 3-Dimensional Perception*

This story begins with one fundamental assumption, an axiom: **‘The world is, in its essence, discontinuous.’**

The world we experience has two faces: the ‘interpolated world (xyt)’, constructed by smoothly connecting discontinuous data, and the ‘predicted world (xyz)’, built by inferring the next structure based on the patterns within that experience. We believe this process consists of an ultra-high-speed interpolation-prediction feedback loop. If so, what is intelligence? It is the function of the interpolation and prediction feedback loop.

### Chapter 1: The Wrong Dimensions, The New Coordinates — The 2+2 Lens to See the World
We have commonly understood the world in ‘3+1 dimensions’. By dissecting the way intelligence processes reality, we discover that the world is built upon entirely different coordinates.

**1. Again, The Four Layers of Reality (tz-Theory)**
The experience we call ‘reality’ is a structure in which at least four different layers are superimposed.
- **Level 1 (Perception — x,y):** The world of raw, unprocessed 2D data.
- **Level 2 (Cognition — x,y,t):** The dynamic world where the brain detects ‘change (Δ)’ and constructs the experience of ‘time (t)’.
- **Level 3 (Imagination — x,y,z):** The world of analysis where the brain ‘pauses’ the flow to predict a static structure, which is ‘depth (z)’.
- **Level 4 (Conception — 4D):** The world we cannot directly access, the source of the ‘Laws of Physics’.

**2. The 2+2 Dimensional Redefinition: Z is ‘Structure’, T is ‘Flow’**
The z-axis (depth) is not a spatial axis of the same kind as x and y.
- **Conventional:** ‘3+1 dimensions’ (xyz as spatial axes + t as the time axis).
- **Our Definition:** ‘2+2 dimensions’ (xy as spatial axes + tz as the time and structure axes).
Within this new definition, z is redefined as the dimension that deals with **‘structure,’** and t becomes the **‘interpolation process’** that connects those structures.

**3. The Condition of 3-Dimensional Experience**
Our ‘3-dimensionality’ stems from the ability to ‘feign’ as if we are living in a single reality by traversing back and forth between interpolation (t) and prediction (z) at an extremely high speed.
- **xyt (Interpolation Mode):** Generates temporal connections (walking towards a door).
- **xyz (Prediction Mode):** Grasps spatial structure (there is a door over there).
This cycle is so fast that we are under the illusion that we are living in a single, continuous reality.

### Chapter 2: The Law of the Engine — Why We Think in ‘Flickers’
The prediction(z)-interpolation(t) circulation engine is governed by a single, absolute law: **The Principle of Non-Simultaneity.**

1.  **Two Mutually Exclusive Modes: The Dilemma of ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure’**
    Intelligence cannot perfectly process ‘flow’ and ‘structure’ at the same time.
    *   The moment structure is grasped (Mode Z), time is paused.
    *   The moment one interpolates along time (Mode T), structure becomes blurred.
    These two modes are mutually exclusive. Therefore, intelligence is an endless process of **flickering** — ‘pausing to see structure, and moving to feel flow.’

2.  **The Ontological Inevitability of ‘Flickering’**
    Why is our intelligence bound to this fate? Because for interpolation and prediction to happen simultaneously would mean 4-dimensionality. We are within the condition of 3-dimensional experience, and this ‘flickering’ is the only and most efficient survival strategy under that condition.

### Chapter 3: The Products of ‘Flickering’ — Three Keys to Unlock the Secrets of the World
This single principle of ‘non-simultaneous flickering’ creates three powerful ‘keys’ that unlock the deepest mysteries of human experience and physics.

**Key 1 (Everyday Experience): The Diverse Faces of ‘Subjective Time’**
The way our limited resource of ‘attention’ is focused changes our subjective perception of time.
- **Immersion (Mode Z Dominance):** When deeply engrossed in predicting a ‘future structure’ (creative work), we lose our sense of time.
- **Enjoyment (Voluntary T-Mode):** When appreciating nature, we voluntarily stop prediction(z) and pay full attention to the present ‘flow.’
- **Tedium (Involuntary T-Mode):** In situations like a boring lecture, we are involuntarily trapped in the ‘flow’ without a structure to predict.

**Key 2 (The Grand Narrative): The Origin of the ‘Arrow of Time’**
Why does time flow in only one direction? Because our perception can only process sequentially: interpolation → prediction → feedback → (enhanced) interpolation... This follows an informationally irreversible sequence. Our perception ‘creates’ the irreversibility of time.

**Key 3 (Pure Theory): A Reinterpretation of the ‘Uncertainty Principle’**
Why is it impossible to know a particle’s ‘position’ and ‘momentum’ accurately at the same time?
- **Position:** A question about ‘spatial structure(z)’. To know it is to ‘pause time’ (Mode Z).
- **Momentum:** A question about change over a flow of time(Δt), i.e., the ‘temporal flow(t)’. To know it is to ‘track the flow’ (Mode T).
The impossibility of knowing both simultaneously is because our perceptual system cannot activate Mode Z and Mode T at the same time. The uncertainty principle is not a mysterious property of the world, but a fundamental operational constraint of the ‘intelligence’ that observes it.

### Conclusion
> “We create the world by flickering between flow and structure.
> The flickering is so fast, we call it ‘reality’.”

This is the single conclusion we have reached. We demonstrated that the engine's fundamental constraint, ‘non-simultaneity’, is a ‘master key’ that explains the ‘direction of time’ and the ‘uncertainty of the quantum world’. We are active ‘Reality Interpreters’ who weave discontinuous data into our own meaningful narratives.

### Supplement: A Proposal on the Practical Extensibility of the Theory
The core principle of this theory — ‘the observer’s perceptual mode defines the layers of reality’ — holds the potential to offer a new clue to solving engineering challenges, particularly in **Quantum Computing.**

1.  **The Dilemma of Current Quantum Computing:** The act of **Measurement** (a z-mode act to fix a ‘structure’) collapses the state of **Quantum Superposition** (a t-mode ‘flow’ of possibilities). Current research takes a ‘defensive’ approach to fight this ‘collapse.’

2.  **A New Paradigm: Coexistence with ‘Uncertainty’**
    Instead of fighting ‘collapse,’ we can embrace the Uncertainty Principle as a ‘design principle.’

3.  **Conceptual Blueprint of a ‘Prediction-Based Quantum Computing’ Architecture**
    This architecture would mimic our intelligence’s ‘t-z cycle.’ It would circulate between:
    *   **Minimal Structural Probing (z-mode ‘tap’):** A brief and limited ‘weak measurement’ to get a faint snapshot of the system's past state.
    *   **Powerful Predictive Computation (dominant z-mode):** Using this faint data as a basis to perform a powerful internal simulation.
    This ultra-high-speed feedback loop would stably move toward a ‘statistically useful enough’ result while minimizing collapse. This is not an immediately applicable blueprint, but it offers an unexpected perspective.
