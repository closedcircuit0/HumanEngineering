# The Physics of Flickering: From Subjective Time to Quantum Uncertainty

*The Origin of the Arrow of Time and Quantum Uncertainty: The Inevitable Consequence of 3-Dimensional Perception*

This story begins with one fundamental assumption, an axiom: ‘The world is, in its essence, discontinuous.’

At this point, we cannot view the world solely as an independently existing entity. We can only see the world by perceiving it, and therefore, what lies beyond our perception is, in principle, unverifiable.

This is where the ‘tz-axis theory’ emerges. The world we experience has two faces: the ‘interpolated world (xyt)’, constructed by smoothly connecting discontinuous data, and the ‘predicted world (xyz)’, built by inferring the next structure based on the patterns within that experience.

These two worlds perceive, or rather ‘create,’ reality through their mutual circulation.

We believe this process consists of an ultra-high-speed interpolation-prediction feedback loop.

If so, what is intelligence?

It is the function of the interpolation and prediction feedback loop.

The full implications of this, particularly for the relationship between human and artificial intelligence, will be explored in a subsequent discussion. Our focus in this report is to use this foundational principle to shed new light on the nature of spacetime and reality.

### Chapter 1: The Wrong Dimensions, The New Coordinates — The 2+2 Lens to See the World
We have commonly understood the world in ‘3+1 dimensions’ — three spatial axes (x, y, z) and one temporal axis (t). This definition, however, may be the result of a misunderstanding of how our perception operates. By precisely dissecting the way intelligence processes reality, we discover that the world is built upon entirely different coordinates.

**1. Again, The Four Layers of Reality(tz-Theory)**
The experience we call ‘reality’ is a structure in which at least four different layers are superimposed.
- **Level 1 (Perception — x,y):** The world of raw, unprocessed 2D data.
- **Level 2 (Cognition — x,y,t):** The dynamic world where the brain detects ‘change (Δ)’ from Level 1 data and constructs the experience of ‘time (t)’ by weaving its flow causally.
- **Level 3 (Imagination — x,y,z):** The world of analysis and thought, where the brain ‘pauses’ the dynamic flow of Level 2 to analyze its patterns and predict a static structure, which is the ‘depth of space (z)’.
- **Level 4 (Conception — 4D):** The world we cannot directly access. The entire structure that governs this whole process, the source of what we perceive as the ‘Laws of Physics’.

**2. The 2+2 Dimensional Redefinition: Z is ‘Structure’, T is ‘Flow’**
This layered structure reveals that the conventional ‘3+1 dimensional’ model is fundamentally flawed. The z-axis (depth) is not a spatial axis of the same kind as the x and y axes.
The conventional approach defines it as ‘3+1 dimensions’ with xyz as spatial axes + t as the time axis. However, we define it as ‘2+2 dimensions’ with xy as spatial axes + tz as the time and structure axes.
Within this new definition, z is redefined not as space, but as the dimension that deals with ‘structure,’ forming a ‘two-sides-of-a-coin’ relationship with time. And t is no longer a simple flow; it becomes the ‘interpolation process’ that connects those structures.

**3. The Condition of 3-Dimensional Experience**
Our ‘3-dimensionality’ stems from the ability to ‘feign’ as if we are living in ‘a single, continuous 3D+time reality’ by traversing back and forth between these two key intellectual functions, interpolation (t) and prediction (z), at an extremely high speed. Without intelligence, we could not have become 3-dimensional beings.
- **xyt (Interpolation Mode):** Generates temporal connections (walking towards a door, moving to avoid an obstacle, a ball flying towards you).
- **xyz (Prediction Mode):** Grasps spatial structure (there is a door over there, there is an obstacle in front, I am about to be hit by the ball).
We are not purely fixed 3-dimensional beings, because we are constantly commuting between these two processing dimensions. “Capture a pattern in xyz from the data accumulated in xyt → interpolate and remember the pattern in xyt, correct the probability → discover a new structure in xyz → back to xyt…” This cycle is so fast that we are under the illusion that we are living in a single, continuous reality. The difference in the ability to switch between these two modes may be, perhaps, one of the clues that explains the various aspects of intelligence.

### Chapter 2: The Law of the Engine — Why We Think in ‘Flickers’
The ‘prediction(z)-interpolation(t)’ circulation engine of intelligence, which we call ‘reality,’ is governed by a single, absolute law: The Principle of Non-Simultaneity. This principle is not a mere constraint; it is, paradoxically, the very creative law that gives rise to all the unique properties of our experience.

**1. Two Mutually Exclusive Modes: The Dilemma of ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure’**
Theoretically and experientially, intelligence cannot perfectly process ‘flow’ and ‘structure’ at the same time.
- The moment structure is grasped (Mode Z), time is paused. To clearly analyze and predict the static structure(xyz) of an object, one must pause the ever-changing flow of time(t) and fix the object into a single ‘snapshot.’ A structure becomes blurred in a dynamic state.
- The moment one interpolates along time (Mode T), structure becomes blurred. To react to and experience the dynamic flow(xyt) of an object, one must stop analyzing its fixed structure and surrender to change itself. A flow cannot be experienced in a static state.
These two modes are mutually exclusive. Therefore, intelligence is, in essence, an endless process of ‘flickering’ — ‘pausing to see structure, and moving to feel flow.’ Though we seem to perform interpolation and prediction simultaneously, it is only because this ‘flickering’ is so fast that we perceive it as concurrent.

**2. The Condition of 3-Dimensional Experience: The Ontological Inevitability of ‘Flickering’**
Why is our intelligence bound to this fate of ‘flickering’?
Because for interpolation and prediction to happen simultaneously would mean that the tz-axis acts on the xy-axis at the same time, which in turn means 4-dimensionality. We would perceive the truly discontinuous world as discontinuous, without the ‘illusion of reality’ we experience, which would mean a state of perfect, holistic perception
We cannot do that. We are within the condition of 3-dimensional experience, and this ‘flickering’ is the only and most efficient survival strategy we could adopt to comprehend the whole of reality under that condition. Therefore, the possibility of 4-dimensional perception is deductively blocked by the previously stated axiom of ‘discontinuity’. Our condition of existence defines our mode of perception.

### Chapter 3: The Products of ‘Flickering’ — Three Keys to Unlock the Secrets of the World
This single principle of ‘non-simultaneous flickering’ in itself creates three powerful ‘keys’ that unlock the deepest mysteries of human experience and physics.

**Key 1 (Everyday Experience): The Diverse Faces of ‘Subjective Time’**
The way our limited resource of ‘attention’ is focused on one of the two perceptual modes, and ‘how’ it is focused, diversely changes our subjective perception of time.
- **Immersion (Mode Z Dominance):** When deeply engrossed in predicting and designing a ‘future structure,’ like in creative work or problem-solving, the brain suppresses the t-mode that detects ‘flow.’ As a result, we lose our sense of time and feel “as if time has stopped.”
- **The Two Sides of Mode T: Enjoyment and Tedium:** Both cases share the commonality of being in a t-mode dominant state where there is no new structure to predict.
  - *Enjoyment (Voluntary T-Mode):* When appreciating beautiful nature, we voluntarily stop prediction(z) and pay full attention to the present ‘flow.’
  - *Tedium (Involuntary T-Mode):* In situations like listening to a boring lecture, we are involuntarily trapped in the ‘flow’ despite the lack of a structure to predict.
- **The Dance of Attention in Repetitive Work:**
  ‘Simple repetitive work’ is the most interesting case study that shows how these two modes dynamically switch.
  - *‘Immersion’ within Repetition (Mode Z Dominance):* If the repetitive task requires some precision, our attention immediately focuses on predicting the task’s own ‘structure (z)’. We enter a state of ‘immersion.’
  - *‘Tedium’ within Repetition (Mode T Dominance):* If the task is extremely simple with no prediction required, our attention fails to find a meaningful structure(z) and becomes trapped in the ‘flow (t)’.

**Key 2 (The Grand Narrative): The Origin of the ‘Arrow of Time’**
Why does time flow in only one direction? The answer lies in the processing sequence of this ‘flickering.’
If the xyt and xyz could be processed simultaneously, the order of past→present→future would become meaningless.
However, our perception can only process sequentially. That is, interpolation → prediction → feedback loop → (prediction-enhanced) interpolation → … This follows an informationally irreversible sequence. Our perception ‘creates’ the irreversibility of time.

**Key 3 (Pure Theory): A Reinterpretation of the ‘Uncertainty Principle’**
Why is it impossible to know a particle’s ‘position’ and ‘momentum’ accurately at the same time?
- **Position:** A question about ‘spatial structure(z)’. To know the precise position is an act of ‘pausing time’.
- **Momentum:** A question about the change in position over a flow of time(Δt), i.e., the ‘temporal flow(t)’. To know the precise momentum is an act of ‘tracking the flow’.
The impossibility of knowing ‘position’ and ‘momentum’ simultaneously is because our perceptual system cannot activate ‘structure grasping(Mode Z)’ and ‘flow grasping(Mode T)’ at the same time. The uncertainty principle is not a mysterious property of the world, but a fundamental operational constraint of the ‘intelligence’ that observes it.
- **Explaining Particle-Wave Duality:** The ‘particle nature’ (fixed position) could be its appearance in z-mode, while its ‘wave nature’ (distributed momentum) could be its appearance in t-mode.
- **Redefining the Observer Effect:** The observer does not change the world. The observer, according to the perceptual mode they have chosen, merely experiences different layers of the world.

### [Conclusion]
> “We create the world by flickering between flow and structure.
> The flickering is so fast, we call it ‘reality’.”

This is the single conclusion we have reached. We demonstrated that the fundamental constraint inherent in this engine, ‘non-simultaneity’, is not a limitation but a ‘master key’ that explains the ‘direction of time’ and the ‘uncertainty of the quantum world’.
We are not passive observers of a given reality. We are active ‘Reality Interpreters’ who, within our own conditions of existence, weave discontinuous data into our own meaningful narratives.

### [Supplement]
*A Personal Proposal on the Practical Extensibility of the Theory: A New Path for Quantum Computing Architecture*
Personally, as I believe that all theories must be grounded in coherence with reality and feasibility, I propose that the core principle of this theory — the insight that ‘the observer’s perceptual mode (the t-z cycle) defines the layers of reality’ — holds the potential to offer a new clue to solving the most acute engineering challenges of reality.
The most promising field of application for this is ‘Quantum Computing.’

**1. The Fundamental Dilemma of Current Quantum Computing: ‘Measurement’ as a Destructive Act**
The greatest barrier facing modern quantum computing is the fact that the powerful state of ‘quantum superposition’ is easily ‘collapsed’ (Decoherence) by the act of ‘Measurement’.
- **The Quantum State (t-mode/wave nature):** While a computation is running, a qubit exists in a ‘wave’ state of superimposed possibilities, a ‘flow (t)’.
- **The Act of Measurement (z-mode/particle nature):** The moment a ‘measurement’ is made, this flow collapses, and the state is fixed into a single, classical ‘structure (z)’.
The current mainstream research takes a highly ‘defensive’ approach, trying to fight this enemy called ‘collapse.’

**2. A Proposal for a New Paradigm: Coexistence with ‘Uncertainty’**
Our theory allows for a completely different approach. Instead of fighting ‘collapse,’ we can accept the essence of the Uncertainty Principle and embrace it as a ‘design principle.’
We can move beyond the paradigm of a ‘war against error’ to explore a new path of ‘coexistence with uncertainty.’

**3. The Conceptual Blueprint of a ‘Prediction-Based Quantum Computing’ Architecture**
An architecture based on this new philosophy would mimic our intelligence’s ‘t-z cycle’.
- **Minimal Structural Probing (The z-Mode ‘Tap’):** It performs an extremely brief and limited ‘weak measurement’ to ask, “What is the structure right now?”.
- **Past Data Acquisition (The t-Mode Result):** Through this z-mode act, we obtain ‘faint and incomplete past data (t)’.
- **Powerful Predictive Computation (Dominant z-Mode Prediction):** The computer then uses this newly acquired ‘faint data (t)’ as a basis to perform a powerful internal simulation.
- **Ultra-High-Speed Feedback Loop:** It circulates between this ‘faint measurement’ and ‘powerful prediction’ at an extremely high speed.
Of course, numerous technical challenges exist. This is not an engineering blueprint that can be immediately applied.
However, I believe this can offer an unexpected perspective on how future quantum computers might overcome their fundamental limitations.
