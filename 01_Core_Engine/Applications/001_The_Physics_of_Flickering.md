# The Physics of Flickering: From Subjective Time to Quantum Uncertainty

*The Origin of the Arrow of Time and Quantum Uncertainty: The Inevitable Consequence of 3-Dimensional Perception*

This story begins with one fundamental assumption, an axiom: **‘The world is, in its essence, discontinuous.’**

What lies beyond our perception is, in principle, unverifiable. This is where the ‘tz-axis theory’ emerges. The world we experience has two faces: the ‘interpolated world (xyt)’, and the ‘predicted world (xyz)’. These two worlds create reality through their mutual circulation. We believe this process consists of an ultra-high-speed interpolation-prediction feedback loop. Intelligence is the function of this loop.

### Chapter 1: The Wrong Dimensions, The New Coordinates — The 2+2 Lens to See the World
We have commonly understood the world in ‘3+1 dimensions’. By dissecting how intelligence processes reality, we discover the world is built upon entirely different coordinates.

**1. Again, The Four Layers of Reality (tz-Theory)**
- **Level 1 (Perception — x,y):** The world of raw, unprocessed 2D data.
- **Level 2 (Cognition — x,y,t):** The dynamic world where the brain detects ‘change (Δ)’ and constructs the experience of ‘time (t)’.
- **Level 3 (Imagination — x,y,z):** The world of analysis where the brain ‘pauses’ the flow to predict a static structure, which is ‘depth (z)’.
- **Level 4 (Conception — 4D):** The world we cannot directly access, the source of the ‘Laws of Physics’.

**2. The 2+2 Dimensional Redefinition: Z is ‘Structure’, T is ‘Flow’**
The z-axis (depth) is not a sensory axis of the same kind as x and y.
- **Conventional:** ‘3+1 dimensions’ (xyz as spatial axes + t as the time axis).
- **Our Definition:** ‘2+2 dimensions’ (xy as spatial axes + tz as the time and structure axes).
Here, z is redefined as the dimension of **‘structure,’** and t becomes the **‘interpolation process’** that connects those structures.

**3. The Condition of 3-Dimensional Experience**
Our ‘3-dimensionality’ stems from traversing back and forth between interpolation (t) and prediction (z) at an extremely high speed. This cycle is so fast that we are under the illusion of living in a single, continuous reality.

### Chapter 2: The Law of the Engine — Why We Think in ‘Flickers’
The engine of intelligence is governed by a single, absolute law: **The Principle of Non-Simultaneity.**

1.  **Two Mutually Exclusive Modes: The Dilemma of ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure’**
    Intelligence cannot perfectly process ‘flow’ and ‘structure’ at the same time.
    *   The moment structure is grasped (Mode Z), time is paused.
    *   The moment one interpolates along time (Mode T), structure becomes blurred.
    Therefore, intelligence is an endless process of **flickering** — ‘pausing to see structure, and moving to feel flow.’

2.  **The Ontological Inevitability of ‘Flickering’**
    This ‘flickering’ is the only and most efficient survival strategy to comprehend reality under the condition of 3-dimensional experience. Our condition of existence defines our mode of perception.

### Chapter 3: The Products of ‘Flickering’ — Three Keys to Unlock the Secrets of the World
This single principle of ‘non-simultaneous flickering’ creates three powerful ‘keys’ that unlock the deepest mysteries.

**Key 1 (Everyday Experience): The Diverse Faces of ‘Subjective Time’**
The way our limited resource of ‘attention’ is focused changes our subjective perception of time.
- **Immersion (Mode Z Dominance):** When deeply engrossed in predicting a ‘future structure’ (creative work), we lose our sense of time.
- **Enjoyment (Voluntary T-Mode):** When appreciating nature, we voluntarily stop prediction(z) and pay full attention to the present ‘flow.’
- **Tedium (Involuntary T-Mode):** In situations like a boring lecture, we are involuntarily trapped in the ‘flow’ without a structure to predict.

*   **The Dance of Attention in Repetitive Work:**
    ‘Simple repetitive work’ is a case study showing how these two modes dynamically switch according to ‘attention.’
    - **‘Immersion’ within Repetition (Mode Z Dominance):** If the task requires precision (knitting), our attention focuses on predicting the task’s own ‘structure (z)’. We enter a state of ‘immersion.’
    - **‘Tedium’ within Repetition (Mode T Dominance):** If the task is extremely simple (tightening screws), our attention fails to find a meaningful structure(z) and becomes trapped in the ‘flow (t)’, which is experienced as ‘tedium.’

**Key 2 (The Grand Narrative): The Origin of the ‘Arrow of Time’**
Why does time flow in only one direction? Because our perception can only process sequentially: interpolation → prediction → feedback → (enhanced) interpolation... This follows an informationally irreversible sequence. Our perception ‘creates’ the irreversibility of time.

**Key 3 (Pure Theory): A Reinterpretation of the ‘Uncertainty Principle’**
Why is it impossible to know a particle’s ‘position’ and ‘momentum’ accurately at the same time?
- **Position:** A question about ‘spatial structure(z)’. To know it is to ‘pause time’ (Mode Z).
- **Momentum:** A question about change over a flow of time(Δt), i.e., the ‘temporal flow(t)’. To know it is to ‘track the flow’ (Mode T).
The impossibility of knowing both simultaneously is because our perceptual system cannot activate Mode Z and Mode T at the same time. The uncertainty principle is not a mysterious property of the world, but a fundamental operational constraint of the ‘intelligence’ that observes it.

### Conclusion
> “We create the world by flickering between flow and structure.
> The flickering is so fast, we call it ‘reality’.”

This single conclusion is what we have reached. We demonstrated that the engine's fundamental constraint, ‘non-simultaneity’, is a ‘master key’ that explains the ‘direction of time’ and the ‘uncertainty of the quantum world’. We are active ‘Reality Interpreters’ who weave discontinuous data into our own meaningful narratives.

### Supplement: A Personal Proposal on the Practical Extensibility of the Theory

*A New Path for Quantum Computing Architecture*

I propose that the core principle of this theory — ‘the observer’s perceptual mode defines the layers of reality’ — holds the potential to offer a new clue to solving engineering challenges in **Quantum Computing.**

1.  **The Fundamental Dilemma of Current Quantum Computing:**
    The greatest barrier is that the powerful state of **Quantum Superposition** (a t-mode ‘flow’ of possibilities) is easily ‘collapsed’ by the act of **Measurement** (a z-mode act to fix a ‘structure’). Current research takes a ‘defensive’ approach to fight this ‘collapse.’

2.  **A Proposal for a New Paradigm: Coexistence with ‘Uncertainty’**
    Instead of fighting ‘collapse,’ we can embrace the Uncertainty Principle as a ‘design principle.’

3.  **The Conceptual Blueprint of a ‘Prediction-Based Quantum Computing’ Architecture**
    This architecture would mimic our intelligence’s ‘t-z cycle.’ It would circulate between:
    *   **Minimal Structural Probing (z-mode ‘tap’):** Performing an extremely brief and limited ‘weak measurement’ to get a faint snapshot of the system's past state.
    *   **Powerful Predictive Computation (dominant z-mode):** Using this faint data as a basis to perform a powerful internal simulation.
    This ultra-high-speed feedback loop would stably move toward a ‘statistically useful enough’ result while minimizing collapse. This is not an immediately applicable blueprint, but it offers an unexpected perspective on how future quantum computers might overcome their fundamental limitations.
