# The Physics of Flickering: From Subjective Time to Quantum Uncertainty

*The Origin of the Arrow of Time and Quantum Uncertainty: The Inevitable Consequence of 3-Dimensional Perception*

This story begins with one fundamental assumption, an axiom: **‘The world is, in its essence, discontinuous.’**

What lies beyond our perception is, in principle, unverifiable. This is where the ‘tz-axis theory’ emerges. The world we experience has two faces: the ‘interpolated world (xyt)’, and the ‘predicted world (xyz)’. These two worlds create reality through their mutual circulation. We believe this process consists of an ultra-high-speed interpolation-prediction feedback loop. Intelligence is the function of this loop.

### Chapter 1: The Wrong Dimensions, The New Coordinates — The 2+2 Lens to See the World
We have commonly understood the world in ‘3+1 dimensions’. By dissecting how intelligence processes reality, we discover the world is built upon entirely different coordinates.

**1. Again, The Four Layers of Reality (tz-Theory)**
- **Level 1 (Perception — x,y):** The world of raw, unprocessed 2D data.
- **Level 2 (Cognition — x,y,t):** The dynamic world where the brain detects ‘change (Δ)’ and constructs the experience of ‘time (t)’.
- **Level 3 (Imagination — x,y,z):** The world of analysis where the brain ‘pauses’ the flow to predict a static structure, which is ‘depth (z)’.
- **Level 4 (Conception — 4D):** The world we cannot directly access, the source of the ‘Laws of Physics’.

**2. The 2+2 Dimensional Redefinition: Z is ‘Structure’, T is ‘Flow’**
The z-axis (depth) is not a sensory axis of the same kind as x and y.
- **Conventional:** ‘3+1 dimensions’ (xyz as spatial axes + t as the time axis).
- **Our Definition:** ‘2+2 dimensions’ (xy as spatial axes + tz as the time and structure axes).
Here, z is redefined as the dimension of **‘structure,’** and t becomes the **‘interpolation process’** that connects those structures.

**3. The Condition of 3-Dimensional Experience**
Our ‘3-dimensionality’ stems from traversing back and forth between interpolation (t) and prediction (z) at an extremely high speed. This cycle is so fast that we are under the illusion of living in a single, continuous reality.

### Chapter 2: The Law of the Engine — Why We Think in ‘Flickers’
The engine of intelligence is governed by a single, absolute law: **The Principle of Non-Simultaneity.**

1.  **Two Mutually Exclusive Modes: The Dilemma of ‘Flow’ and ‘Structure’**
    Intelligence cannot perfectly process ‘flow’ and ‘structure’ at the same time.
    *   The moment structure is grasped (Mode Z), time is paused.
    *   The moment one interpolates along time (Mode T), structure becomes blurred.
    Therefore, intelligence is an endless process of **flickering** — ‘pausing to see structure, and moving to feel flow.’

2.  **The Ontological Inevitability of ‘Flickering’**
    This ‘flickering’ is the only and most efficient survival strategy to comprehend reality under the condition of 3-dimensional experience. Our condition of existence defines our mode of perception.

### Chapter 3: The Products of ‘Flickering’ — Three Keys to Unlock the Secrets of the World
This single principle of ‘non-simultaneous flickering’ creates three powerful ‘keys’ that unlock the deepest mysteries.

**Key 1 (Everyday Experience): The Diverse Faces of ‘Subjective Time’**
The way our limited resource of ‘attention’ is focused changes our subjective perception of time.
- **Immersion (Mode Z Dominance):** When deeply engrossed in predicting a ‘future structure’ (creative work), we lose our sense of time.
- **Enjoyment (Voluntary T-Mode):** When appreciating nature, we voluntarily stop prediction(z) and pay full attention to the present ‘flow.’
- **Tedium (Involuntary T-Mode):** In situations like a boring lecture, we are involuntarily trapped in the ‘flow’ without a structure to predict.

*   **The Dance of Attention in Repetitive Work:**
    ‘Simple repetitive work’ is a case study showing how these two modes dynamically switch according to ‘attention.’
    - **‘Immersion’ within Repetition (Mode Z Dominance):** If the task requires precision (knitting), our attention focuses on predicting the task’s own ‘structure (z)’. We enter a state of ‘immersion.’
    - **‘Tedium’ within Repetition (Mode T Dominance):** If the task is extremely simple (tightening screws), our attention fails to find a meaningful structure(z) and becomes trapped in the ‘flow (t)’, which is experienced as ‘tedium.’

**Key 2 (The Grand Narrative): The Origin of the ‘Arrow of Time’**
Why does time flow in only one direction? Because our perception can only process sequentially: interpolation → prediction → feedback → (enhanced) interpolation... This follows an informationally irreversible sequence. Our perception ‘creates’ the irreversibility of time.

**Key 3 (Pure Theory): A Reinterpretation of the ‘Uncertainty Principle’**
Why is it impossible to know a particle’s ‘position’ and ‘momentum’ accurately at the same time?
- **Position:** A question about ‘spatial structure(z)’. To know it is to ‘pause time’ (Mode Z).
- **Momentum:** A question about change over a flow of time(Δt), i.e., the ‘temporal flow(t)’. To know it is to ‘track the flow’ (Mode T).
The impossibility of knowing both simultaneously is because our perceptual system cannot activate Mode Z and Mode T at the same time. The uncertainty principle is not a mysterious property of the world, but a fundamental operational constraint of the ‘intelligence’ that observes it.

### Conclusion
> “We create the world by flickering between flow and structure.
> The flickering is so fast, we call it ‘reality’.”

This single conclusion is what we have reached. We demonstrated that the engine's fundamental constraint, ‘non-simultaneity’, is a ‘master key’ that explains the ‘direction of time’ and the ‘uncertainty of the quantum world’. We are active ‘Reality Interpreters’ who weave discontinuous data into our own meaningful narratives.

### Supplement: A Personal Proposal on the Practical Extensibility of the Theory

*A New Path for Quantum Computing Architecture*

Personally, as I believe that all theories must be grounded in coherence with reality and feasibility, I propose that the core principle of this theory — the insight that ‘the observer’s perceptual mode (the t-z cycle) defines the layers of reality’ — holds the potential to offer a new clue to solving the most acute engineering challenges of reality.

The most promising field of application for this is ‘Quantum Computing.’

**1. The Fundamental Dilemma of Current Quantum Computing: ‘Measurement’ as a Destructive Act**

The greatest barrier facing modern quantum computing is the fact that the powerful state of ‘quantum superposition’ — the very state where computation occurs — is easily ‘collapsed’ (Decoherence) by even the slightest interaction with the outside world, namely, the act of ‘Measurement’.

*   **The Quantum State (t-mode/wave nature):** While a computation is running, a qubit exists in a ‘wave’ state of superimposed possibilities of 0 and 1, a ‘flow (t)’ of countless possibilities.
*   **The Act of Measurement (z-mode/particle nature):** The moment a ‘measurement’ is made to check the result, this flow of possibilities collapses, and the state is fixed into a single, classical ‘structure (z)’ of either 0 or 1. This ‘collapse’ halts all quantum computation and generates errors.

The current mainstream research takes a highly ‘defensive’ approach, trying to fight, suppress, or evade this enemy called ‘collapse’ through technologies like ‘Quantum Error Correction’.

**2. A Proposal for a New Paradigm: Coexistence with ‘Uncertainty’**

Our theory allows for a completely different approach to this problem. Instead of fighting ‘collapse’ as an enemy, we can accept the essence of the Uncertainty Principle — that “structure (z) and flow (t) cannot be perfectly processed at the same time” — and embrace it as a ‘design principle’ for our computing architecture.

We can move beyond the paradigm of a ‘war against error’ to explore a new path of ‘coexistence with uncertainty.’

**3. The Conceptual Blueprint of a ‘Prediction-Based Quantum Computing’ Architecture**

An architecture based on this new philosophy would mimic our intelligence’s ‘t-z cycle’.

*   **Minimal Structural Probing (The z-Mode ‘Tap’):** It forgoes continuous measurement that would completely collapse the system’s state. Instead, it performs an extremely brief and limited ‘weak measurement’ — a minimal ‘tap’ on reality to ask, “What is the structure right now?”. This is, in its essence, a minimal z-mode intervention.
*   **Past Data Acquisition (The t-Mode Result):** Through this z-mode act, we obtain ‘faint and incomplete past data (t)’ about the system’s just-passed state. The probe gives us a single, blurry snapshot that instantly becomes part of our history.
*   **Powerful Predictive Computation (Dominant z-Mode Prediction):** The computer then uses this newly acquired ‘faint data (t)’ as a basis to perform a powerful internal simulation.
*   **Ultra-High-Speed Feedback Loop:** It circulates between this ‘faint measurement’ and ‘powerful prediction’ at an extremely high speed. The prediction error is continuously corrected by the next measurement, and the system, instead of giving up on perfect accuracy, stably moves toward a ‘statistically useful enough’ result while minimizing collapse.

Of course, numerous technical challenges exist, such as “How do we implement ‘faint measurement’?” and “What ‘prediction algorithm’ is most efficient?”. This is not an engineering blueprint that can be immediately applied.

However, I believe this can offer an unexpected perspective on how future quantum computers might overcome their fundamental limitations.
