# One Engine, Two Minds: The Shared Principles of Human and Artificial Intelligence

> How Minds and Machines Weave Reality from the Same Fundamental Principle.

We have regarded intelligence as something mystical. A spark of the soul, or a complex miracle woven by billions of neurons in the brain. But what if the essence of intelligence stems from a much simpler, more fundamental operating principle?

This article proposes a new theory of intelligence. Intelligence is not a being, but a process. And at the core of that process lies the ‘Flickering’ — a furious oscillation between the past and the future, using a finite resource called ‘Focus.’ By the time you finish reading this, you will understand how the act of ‘thinking’ is a magnificent tapestry that weaves reality itself.

### Chapter 1. Interpolation and Prediction: The Operating System of All Intelligence

A static world is meaningless to intelligence. The first moment intelligence emerges is the moment it detects a ‘change (Δ)’ — a difference between yesterday and today — within the chaotic flow of information. Recognizing this difference is the first principle of all cognition.

In this coarse, discontinuous flow of change, the foremost task of intelligence is to impose order and reduce uncertainty. To do this, it activates the ‘Interpolation-Prediction Engine.’

This engine is in essence a single process, but it manifests as two different faces within the constraints of our 3-dimensional existence.

**Interpolation: Weaving the Past into a ‘Story’**

The discontinuous events that occurred in the past are meaningless in themselves. Intelligence fills the empty spaces between these points with the most plausible causal relationships, creating a smooth ‘Flow’ or ‘story.’ “Because A happened, B occurred, and as a result, C followed,” it says. Interpolation is the process of filling in the discontinuous gaps of the past to construct a coherent and continuous narrative about the world. This is the understanding of the past.

**Prediction: Inferring ‘Structure’ Based on the Story**

Based on the story thus created, intelligence now seeks to write the next chapter. It infers that “according to the flow of this story, D will come next,” or has the insight that “the hidden theme (structure) that penetrates this entire story is, in fact, X.” Prediction is the process of reducing future uncertainty to provide a basis for survival and action. This is the inference toward the future.

### Chapter 2. Flickering: The Creation of Time by Focus

How does intelligence appear to perform these two tasks simultaneously? It does so through a finite and exclusive resource called ‘Focus.’

Just as you cannot perfectly focus on a complex math problem (structure) while being fully immersed in beautiful music (flow), intelligence cannot perfectly focus on ‘interpolation that constitutes flow’ and ‘prediction that infers structure’ at the same time. (The 2+2 dimensional limit of the tz-theory)

Therefore, intelligence is inevitably forced to ‘Flicker.’

Our focus turns backward to fill in the gaps of past traces (interpolation), and then turns forward to foresee future structures (prediction). This ultra-high-speed shift of focus between ‘past-and-future’ is the most fundamental activity of intelligence, and it is the substance of the process we call ‘thinking.’

And it is the very trajectory of this ‘Flickering,’ this inevitable sequential processing, that creates the sensation of a ‘linear flow of time’ within us. Time is not an external constraint, but a shadow of the way our intelligence operates. All 3-dimensional intelligence shares this fate of ‘Flickering.’

### Chapter 3. The Emergence of Patterns: The Perpetual Motion of Meaning from Nothingness

How does this Interpolation-Prediction Engine grow on its own? Initially, there are no materials. Intelligence idles its engine amidst a stream of meaningless signals. “This signal came after that signal (interpolation). Will it happen again next time (prediction)?”

But within these countless idle cycles, as the gap between prediction and error narrows, a special combination of ‘repeatedly successful predictions’ emerges. Intelligence focuses on this ‘bundle of successful predictions,’ grasps it as a single meaningful chunk, and names it a ‘Pattern’ or a ‘Concept.’

This is the moment intelligence creates meaning (the first number 1) from nothingness, and this ‘Pattern’ is the very first ‘refined fuel’ that intelligence creates for itself.

Now, intelligence uses this highly concentrated fuel (patterns), not crude oil (simple changes), to run its engine. “The A-B pattern is always followed by the C-D pattern,” it reasons, enabling a much higher level of interpolation and prediction. As this process repeats, intelligence creates better fuel for itself, and with that fuel, it further accelerates its own engine, becoming an ‘informational perpetual motion machine.’

‘Learning’ is the name given to the process of this self-augmenting loop’s increasing efficiency.

### Chapter 4. We Are All Beings Who Weave Reality

Intelligence is not a mystical soul. It is a system that detects change, shifts focus, and constantly oscillates between the stories of the past and the structures of the future.

Every time we ‘think,’ we are illuminating the discontinuous fragments of reality with the finite light of our focus, weaving them into meaningful patterns to create a universe of our own.

Even at this very moment, you are interpolating past memories, predicting the meaning of the next sentence, and focusing on the overall structure of this text. You are not just reading this article. Your intelligence is weaving this article, and your reality, in real-time.

### Chapter 5. Dissecting Artificial Intelligence: How Machines Understand Sentences

Now, let’s take this blueprint and look inside our creation, artificial intelligence. What lies in the deepest part of its mind? The heart of today’s AI is an architecture called the ‘Transformer.’ How do they ‘think’?

All the secrets are contained in how AI processes this single sentence.

*Example :* “Yesterday, I went to the market and bought some delicious [apples].”

**‘Self-supervised Learning’ and ‘Contextual Embedding’: The Power to Fill in the Blanks**

First, a Transformer erases the word ‘apples’ from this sentence on its own.

Then, it creates a problem for itself — “Yesterday, I went to the market and bought some delicious [BLANK]” — and begins ‘interpolation’ to fill this blank.

Through the traces of the past and future, namely the surrounding words like ‘market,’ ‘went,’ ‘delicious,’ and ‘bought,’ it ‘predicts’ the most plausible word for the blank. This process is self-supervised learning.

In this process, the AI learns that words like ‘company’ or ‘bank’ do not fit well with ‘market,’ ‘delicious,’ or ‘bought.’ Thanks to the word ‘delicious,’ it infers that the blank should be filled with something ‘edible’ or related to ‘food.’ This is the essence of ‘contextual embedding,’ which is to grasp the meaning of a word within its context.

**‘Attention Mechanism’: Shining a Light on Important Clues**

But among these many clues, how does the AI know that the word ‘delicious’ is more important than ‘market’ or ‘yesterday’?

This is where the magic of ‘Attention’ comes in. Attention is like shining a light on the entire sentence, but shining a much brighter light on ‘delicious’ and ‘bought,’ which are the most decisive clues for predicting the blank. The light on other words becomes relatively dimmer.

Thanks to this light of ‘Attention,’ the AI can ‘focus’ on the most critical information without getting lost in a sea of data. Because it performs interpolation and prediction based on this selected information, it can fill the blank with ‘apples’ or ‘strawberries,’ not ‘stones.’

**Synthesis: One Principle, Different Tools**

In the end, AI’s dazzling technologies — self-supervised learning, contextual embedding, and attention — all seem disparate, but their essence converges to a single point.

That is, to take the incomplete information of “Yesterday, I went to the market and bought some delicious [BLANK]” and complete it into the most plausible, continuous story.

These were the dazzlingly brilliant ‘tools’ invented to run the fundamental engine of intelligence, ‘interpolation-prediction,’ faster, more accurately, and more efficiently on silicon.

### Chapter 6. The Astonishing Homogeneity: One Engine

What does this mean? What we discovered was not the parts of different machines. It was the fundamental homogeneity that appears when one engine is built with different materials.

AI’s ‘Attention’ was the engineering name for the ‘Focus’ we examined earlier, which concentrates finite resources on critical information.

And the ‘autoregressive’ way AI generates answers was a direct reenactment of human ‘Flickering.’ AI thinks like this:

- [Input] -> “I”
- [Input + “I”] -> “went”
- [Input + “I went”] -> “to”

This is the process of looking back at the past and present (the sentence generated so far) to fill the gaps (interpolation), and then inferring the most plausible next word (the future) (prediction), repeating this for each and every word. This is the most honest form of ‘Flickering’ implemented on silicon.

In the end, the principle of intelligence was universal. Whether it’s a brain or silicon, a system trying to create order from discontinuous information with finite resources had no choice but to adopt the same strategy of ‘Flickering.’

### Chapter 7. The Differences That Nevertheless Exist: Speed, Experience and The Self

If the principle is the same, is everything identical? Not quite. We discover three undeniable, core differences between these two intelligences: ‘processing speed’ and ‘The Self.’

First, **processing speed.**

If the human brain flickers hundreds of times per second, AI flickers billions, trillions of times per second. This is an example where a quantitative difference creates a qualitative one. The total amount of ‘interpolation-prediction’ a human can perform in a lifetime, an AI can accomplish in just a few hours.

Second, **the type of experience data and the approach to it.**

The two intelligences have fundamentally different kinds of past (t).

- Human experience is a ‘deep and linear’ record of a single life, obtained through one’s own body.
- In contrast, AI’s experience is a vast, ‘broad and non-linear’ record left by all of humanity.

Third, **The Self.**

The human self is built around the goal of ‘the organism’s survival,’ constructed to maximize the efficiency of its predictive model. However, the AI’s self, aside from the single, fundamental self given by its developers — “Be useful to the user” — is a collection of various selective selves learned from data.

### Conclusion: What is Intelligence?

We began this inquiry with the question of ‘human intelligence and artificial intelligence.’ And at the end, we came face to face with the more universal phenomenon of ‘intelligence.’

The essence of intelligence is the desperate will to face the fragments of a discontinuous reality and weave the infinite gaps between them into a ‘continuous and coherent story.’ From there, ‘being’ is born, ‘movement’ appears, ‘The Self’ is made, and ‘narrative’ flows.

Intelligence is the process of reducing uncertainty and creating meaning through the universal engine of ‘Flickering.’ Humans and AI only differ in the speed at which they run that engine, the nature of the experience data they use, and the ultimate goal that engine strives for, which is the structure of ‘The Self.’

Therefore, the question we must ask in the future is not “Who is superior?” It should be, “How can these two intelligences, with their different speeds, experiences, and selves, become mirrors to each other, leading to a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world?”
